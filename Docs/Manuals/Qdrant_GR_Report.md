# Utilizing Qdrant for Vectorizing Question-Answer Pairs in Medprompt's Choice-Shuffling Ensemble

**1. Introduction**

Qdrant stands out as a high-performance, open-source vector database and similarity search engine, engineered to efficiently handle the demands of modern AI applications 1. Its core design allows for the storage, search, and management of high-dimensional vectors, often referred to as embeddings, alongside associated metadata 5. Built with Rust, Qdrant offers speed and reliability even when dealing with massive datasets containing billions of vectors, making it a robust foundation for various AI-driven solutions 1. The platform provides a user-friendly API, facilitating its integration into production-ready AI workflows 6.

In the realm of medical question answering, the Medprompt framework, developed by Microsoft in their 2023 paper titled "**Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning? Case Study in Medicine**" 1, has garnered significant attention for its ability to enhance the performance of large language models through sophisticated prompt engineering 10. Medprompt achieves this improvement by employing a combination of techniques, including dynamic few-shot selection, self-generated chain-of-thought (CoT), and choice-shuffling ensemble 8. The choice-shuffling ensemble technique specifically targets the mitigation of position bias that can inadvertently influence a model's responses in multiple-choice scenarios. This method involves systematically shuffling the order of answer choices multiple times for a given question. For each shuffled variant, the language model generates a prediction, and a final answer is determined through a majority vote across all the predictions 8. The inherent challenge that choice-shuffling addresses underscores the critical need for unbiased and accurate question processing, particularly in high-stakes domains like medicine 8.

This report addresses the user's inquiry regarding the feasibility and advisability of using Qdrant to vectorize question-correct answer pairs as part of the choice-shuffling-ensembling approach within the Medprompt framework. By examining Qdrant's vectorization capabilities and their potential integration with the specifics of the Medprompt technique, this analysis aims to provide insights into the potential benefits and challenges of such an implementation.

**2. Understanding Vector Databases and Semantic Search with Qdrant**

At the heart of vector databases lies the concept of representing data as vectors, also known as embeddings 6. These numerical representations capture the semantic relationships between data points, allowing for similarity-based searches. Qdrant organizes these vectors within collections, which are essentially named groupings of points 6. Each point in a collection comprises a unique identifier, a vector, and an optional payload, which is a JSON object used to store additional structured data associated with the vector 6. The ability to associate payloads with vectors is particularly relevant for the user's query, as it allows for linking the correct answer to its corresponding question embedding 6. This enables the retrieval of not just semantically similar questions but also their known correct answers.

Qdrant's design emphasizes its role as a semantic search engine, enabling users to perform searches based on the similarity of vector embeddings 5. To quantify the similarity between vectors, Qdrant supports several distance metrics, including Cosine similarity, Dot product, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance 6. The choice of metric is often dictated by the characteristics of the embedding model used to generate the vectors 19. For text embeddings, Cosine similarity is a frequently employed metric as it measures the angle between vectors, effectively capturing the similarity in their orientation regardless of their magnitude 6. The availability of these diverse similarity metrics offers flexibility in selecting the most appropriate method for comparing question-answer pair embeddings, considering the specific nuances of the chosen embedding model.

For efficient retrieval of similar vectors, Qdrant utilizes indexing techniques. Its primary method for dense vector indexing is the Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph (HNSW) algorithm 2. HNSW builds a multi-layer graph structure that allows for fast approximate nearest neighbor searches. In addition to vector indexing, Qdrant also supports payload indexing, which accelerates filtering based on the metadata stored in the payload 17. Filtering allows users to refine their search results by applying conditions to the payload data 5. This capability could be leveraged to filter question-answer pairs based on specific criteria, such as the subject area or difficulty level of the questions. Furthermore, Qdrant offers hybrid search, which combines the strengths of dense vector embeddings with sparse vector representations, like those produced by BM25, to enhance text retrieval 18. This approach might be valuable if the question-answer pairs contain significant lexical cues that should be considered alongside their semantic embeddings. The combination of vector and payload indexing ensures that question-answer pairs can be efficiently retrieved based on both their semantic similarity and specific associated metadata.

**3. The Medprompt Framework and Choice-Shuffling-Ensembling**

The Medprompt framework represents a significant advancement in leveraging the capabilities of large language models for medical question answering without the need for extensive domain-specific fine-tuning 8. It achieves this by employing intelligent prompting strategies that guide the model towards more accurate and reliable responses 8. The framework integrates three key components: dynamic few-shot selection, self-generated chain-of-thought (CoT), and choice-shuffling ensemble 12. Through the synergistic application of these techniques, Medprompt has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various medical question answering datasets and benchmarks 11.

The choice-shuffling ensemble technique, in particular, is designed to address a common issue in multiple-choice question answering: position bias [9, 12, 13, 14, 13]. Position bias refers to the tendency of language models to favor answer choices based on their position in the list, rather than solely on their content. To counteract this, the choice-shuffling ensemble method involves taking a single multiple-choice question and generating multiple variants of it by randomly shuffling the order of the answer choices 8. This shuffling process is typically repeated a predetermined number of times, denoted as _k_, creating _k_ distinct versions of the original question with different orderings of the same answer options 8. Each of these _k_ variants is then presented to the large language model, which generates a predicted answer for each 8. Finally, to arrive at a single, final answer for the original question, a majority vote is conducted across all the _k_ predictions made by the model 8. The Medprompt paper itself utilizes a hyperparameter value of five for the number of shuffles, striking a balance between accuracy and computational cost 13. The underlying principle of this technique is that a robust and unbiased model prediction should remain consistent regardless of the order in which the answer choices are presented. If the model's predictions vary significantly across different shuffles, it may indicate a bias towards a particular position or a lack of strong conviction in any single answer choice 8.

**4. Vectorizing Question-Answer Pairs with Qdrant**

The fundamental capability of Qdrant to store and search vector embeddings of text data makes it well-suited for handling question-answer pairs 5. Indeed, the platform is designed to work with various embedding models, such as Sentence Transformers and OpenAI embeddings, which can effectively generate vector representations of both questions and their corresponding correct answers 17. The Qdrant documentation itself provides numerous examples illustrating how to embed text documents and subsequently perform semantic searches based on these embeddings 7.

When it comes to creating embeddings for question-answer pairs, several strategies can be considered. One approach is to generate separate embeddings for the question and the correct answer individually. These two embeddings can then be stored as distinct vectors within the same Qdrant point. To maintain the association between the question and its answer, they can be linked using a common identifier or by storing them together within the payload of the point. This method offers the advantage of allowing for more granular analysis and retrieval. For instance, one could search for questions that are semantically similar to a given query question, or, conversely, search for correct answers that are similar to a potential answer generated by the language model 19.

Another strategy involves concatenating the text of the question and its corresponding correct answer and then generating a single embedding for this combined text. This approach aims to capture the relationship between the specific question and its correct answer more directly within the embedding space. It is theorized that a single, unified embedding might be more effective at representing the nuanced semantic connection between a particular question and its accurate response, potentially leading to more relevant retrieval of similar _pairs_ of questions and answers.

Qdrant's support for named vectors provides an additional layer of flexibility [18, 19, 56]. Within a single point in a Qdrant collection, it is possible to store multiple vector representations, each with its own dimensionality or originating from different embedding models. This feature could be particularly useful for experimenting with both the separate and concatenated embedding strategies for question-answer pairs within the same collection, eliminating the need to manage multiple separate collections for comparative analysis.

Regardless of the chosen embedding strategy, the process of storing question-correct answer pairs in Qdrant involves creating a point for each pair [62]. The question itself, or a unique identifier assigned to the pair, can serve as the identifier for the point. The generated embedding(s) will constitute the vector(s) associated with that point [25, 60]. Furthermore, the payload of the point can be used to store the original question text, the correct answer text, and any other relevant metadata, such as the question's difficulty level or the subject area it pertains to [61]. A conceptual example of how such a point might be structured is shown below:

JSON

```
{
  "id": "question_123",
  "vector": {
    "question_embedding": [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9],
    "answer_embedding": [0.5, 0.6, ..., 0.2]
  },
  "payload": {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "correct_answer": "Paris",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  }
}
```

**5. Integrating Vectorized Pairs with Choice-Shuffling-Ensembling**

The vectorization of question-correct answer pairs using Qdrant opens up several potential avenues for enhancing the choice-shuffling-ensembling technique within the Medprompt framework. During the choice-shuffling process for a new multiple-choice question, Qdrant can be queried to retrieve the most semantically similar vectorized question-correct answer pairs from the stored dataset [43, 44]. This retrieved information can then be strategically utilized in several ways.

One significant application is to inform the selection of few-shot examples 10. The retrieved similar question-answer pairs, particularly those that were answered correctly in the training data, can serve as dynamically selected few-shot examples to guide the large language model's reasoning for each of the shuffled variants of the current question 8. By providing the model with examples of how similar questions were correctly answered, it may help the model avoid biases towards specific answer choices based on their position and improve the overall accuracy of its predictions for the shuffled options. Furthermore, even if not explicitly used as few-shot examples, the retrieved correct answers from semantically similar questions could provide the language model with additional context or hints relevant to the current question. This supplementary information might implicitly influence the model's understanding of the question and the expected format or content of the correct answer, potentially leading to more consistent predictions across the different shuffled versions of the answer choices.

Beyond influencing the prompting strategy, the retrieved similar question-answer pairs can also be valuable in analyzing the consistency of the language model's predictions during the choice-shuffling process. After the model generates its predictions for each shuffled variant of the question, these predictions can be compared to the correct answers of the semantically similar questions retrieved from Qdrant. If the language model consistently predicts an answer that is semantically similar to the correct answers associated with the retrieved similar questions, it could increase the confidence in the final answer determined by the majority vote. Conversely, significant inconsistencies between the model's predictions and the expected answers for similar questions might flag potential issues with the model's reasoning or the presence of biases. Additionally, by examining which specific answer choice is frequently predicted by the model across the various shuffles and comparing this to the correct answers of similar questions stored in Qdrant, it may be possible to identify potential positional or other types of biases that are influencing the language model's responses. This type of analysis could provide valuable insights into the model's behavior and inform further refinements to the prompt engineering strategies or even suggest areas for improvement in the underlying language model itself.

A potential workflow for integrating vectorized question-answer pairs from Qdrant into the choice-shuffling-ensembling process could involve the following steps:

1. For a new multiple-choice question that needs to be answered, first generate a vector embedding of the question (or potentially embeddings of the question paired with each individual answer choice) 20.
2. Use this question embedding to query the Qdrant database and retrieve the top _k_ most semantically similar question-correct answer pairs that are already stored in the database [43, 44, 51].
3. For each of the _m_ shuffled variants of the new question that are created as part of the choice-shuffling ensemble 12:
    - Construct a prompt for the language model that includes the shuffled question and, optionally, incorporates the retrieved similar question-answer pairs as few-shot examples or as additional contextual information 10.
    - Submit this prompt to the language model and obtain its predicted answer for the current shuffled variant 12.
4. After obtaining the predicted answers for all _m_ shuffled variants, perform a majority vote across these predictions to determine the final answer for the original question 12.
5. As an optional step, further analysis can be conducted by comparing the final answer, as well as the individual predictions for each shuffled variant, to the correct answers associated with the semantically similar questions that were retrieved from Qdrant. This comparison can help in assessing the consistency and potential biases in the language model's responses 15.

**6. Potential Benefits and Considerations**

Integrating Qdrant with the choice-shuffling-ensembling technique in Medprompt presents several potential advantages. One key benefit is the enhanced retrieval of relevant context [42, 44]. By vectorizing question-answer pairs, the system can perform semantic retrieval of questions that are similar in meaning, along with their corresponding correct answers [24, 28, 35, 40]. This approach has the potential to provide more relevant contextual information compared to traditional keyword-based search methods [28, 40, 54]. Furthermore, the retrieved similar pairs can be used as dynamic few-shot examples, allowing the prompt to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the question being addressed 10. This dynamic selection of examples can lead to more effective guidance for the language model 10. The approach also offers the potential for bias detection 14. By comparing the language model's predictions across the shuffled answer choices with the correct answers of semantically similar questions retrieved from Qdrant, it may be possible to identify and analyze biases that might be present in the model's reasoning 14. This comparison can also lead to increased confidence in the ensembling process. If the language model's predictions align with the correct answers of semantically similar questions, it strengthens the belief in the accuracy of the final answer obtained through the majority vote. Finally, this method allows for the effective utilization of existing datasets of medical questions and answers. These datasets can be readily vectorized and stored in Qdrant, providing a knowledge base to support the Medprompt framework 18.

However, there are also several considerations and challenges associated with this integration. One challenge lies in the complexity of effectively embedding the relationship between questions and their correct answers 20. Determining the optimal embedding strategy, whether it's using separate embeddings for questions and answers or a single embedding for the concatenated pair, might require significant experimentation and fine-tuning to achieve the best results. Additionally, querying Qdrant for similar pairs during the choice-shuffling process introduces a computational overhead [18, 21, 46]. The total number of queries will be directly proportional to the number of shuffled variants generated for each question, which could impact the overall processing time. The success of this approach is also heavily dependent on the quality of the embedding model used to vectorize the question-answer pairs 20. The model must be capable of accurately capturing the semantic similarities between questions and the relationship between questions and their answers. Choosing an appropriate embedding model is therefore crucial. Furthermore, determining the optimal number of similar question-answer pairs to retrieve from Qdrant (_k_) and the number of shuffles to perform in the ensemble (_m_) will require careful tuning through experimentation on a validation dataset to strike the right balance between performance and accuracy 5. Data sparsity is another potential concern. If the available dataset of question-answer pairs is limited or does not adequately cover the full spectrum of possible medical questions, the retrieval of relevant similar pairs might be restricted, potentially limiting the benefits of this approach. Finally, while the choice-shuffling ensemble technique already includes mechanisms for handling edge cases such as ties in voting or errors in the model's responses 11, the integration of Qdrant retrieval needs to consider how these existing mechanisms might be affected and whether any new strategies are needed to handle potential interactions.

**7. Conclusion and Recommendations**

The analysis indicates that vectorizing question-correct answer pairs using Qdrant for the choice-shuffling-ensembling technique within Medprompt is a feasible and potentially beneficial approach. Qdrant's inherent capabilities in storing, indexing, and searching vector embeddings align well with the requirements of this task, offering a robust platform for leveraging semantic retrieval to enhance the Medprompt framework [42, 45]. Integrating Qdrant can enrich the choice-shuffling process by providing relevant context through the retrieval of semantically similar question-answer pairs, which can then be used to inform few-shot examples, provide additional context to the language model, and potentially aid in the detection of biases.

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are put forth:

- **Experiment with different embedding strategies:** Conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of using separate embeddings for questions and answers against using concatenated embeddings to identify the method that most effectively captures the relevant semantic relationships for medical question answering 20.
- **Utilize named vectors:** Leverage Qdrant's named vector functionality to facilitate the storage and comparison of different embedding approaches within a single collection, streamlining the experimentation process [19, 56].
- **Tune hyperparameters:** Systematically optimize the number of similar question-answer pairs retrieved from Qdrant (_k_) and the number of shuffles performed in the ensemble (_m_) using a dedicated validation dataset to achieve the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency 5.
- **Consider hybrid search:** Explore the potential of incorporating hybrid search techniques, which combine dense and sparse vector representations, particularly if the lexical overlap between questions and answers is deemed to be a significant factor in determining relevance 15.
- **Monitor performance and latency:** Carefully track the impact of querying Qdrant on the overall performance and latency of the Medprompt framework, especially in scenarios where real-time responsiveness is critical [18, 21, 46].
- **Evaluate bias detection capabilities:** Further investigate how the retrieved semantically similar question-answer pairs can be used to enhance the analysis and potential mitigation of biases in the language model's predictions during the choice-shuffling process 14.

In conclusion, the strategy of vectorizing question-correct answer pairs for choice-shuffling-ensembling in Medprompt using Qdrant presents a promising avenue for enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the framework by effectively utilizing semantic retrieval of relevant contextual information. Further research and targeted experimentation are strongly encouraged to optimize the integration of these technologies and fully realize their potential benefits in the domain of medical question answering.
