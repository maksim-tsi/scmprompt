## Structured List Report - Analysis of Microsoft Promptbase Repository - MEDPROMPT Implementation

This report directly addresses the "Targeted Questions for Code and Prompt Engineering Analyst" (questions 1-7) based on the code and documentation analysis of the Microsoft Promptbase repository, with a specific focus on the MedPrompt implementation within the `src/promptbase/mmlu` directory.

**1. Overall Architecture and Design of the Repository**

*   **Answer:** The repository `promptbase` is structured as a collection of resources for prompt engineering, primarily focused on achieving high performance from Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. It demonstrates various prompting techniques, with a strong emphasis on **MedPrompt**. The architecture appears modular, with different directories dedicated to datasets, prompting strategies, and evaluation scripts.  The `azureml` directory indicates integration with Azure Machine Learning for pipeline execution and componentization. The `src/promptbase` directory houses the core Python package, further divided into modules for specific benchmarks (like `mmlu`, `gsm8k`, `bigbench`), datasets, formatting, and utilities. The repository leverages the `guidance` library for prompt programming, as seen in the `aml-tutorial` and `azureml` examples.

*   **Evidence & References:**
    *   **README.md:**  Provides an overview of the repository's purpose, highlighting `Medprompt` and `Medprompt+` as key methodologies. Mentions the goal of demonstrating best practices for eliciting performance from foundation models.
    *   **Directory Structure (microsoft-promptbase.txt):** Shows a clear separation of concerns:
        *   `aml-tutorial/` and `azureml/`:  Demonstrate AzureML pipeline integration.
        *   `guidance_programs/`: Contains Python files defining guidance programs for different prompting strategies.
        *   `src/promptbase/`: Core Python package with modules for datasets, benchmarks, and utilities.
        *   `src/promptbase/mmlu/`:  Specifically targeted for MedPrompt implementation for MMLU benchmark.
    *   **README.md - "Running Scripts" section:**  Indicates modularity by allowing users to run tests for specific datasets (bigbench, drop, gsm8k, humaneval, math, mmlu) using `python -m promptbase dataset_name`.
    *   **aml-tutorial/ReadMe.md:** Describes a simple two-component AzureML pipeline using `guidance`, demonstrating the use of AzureML for workflow orchestration.

*   **Code Snippets:**
    *   **README.md - Table of Benchmarks:** Illustrates the focus on evaluating performance on various benchmarks, including MMLU, using different prompting techniques.
    ```markdown
    | Benchmark | GPT-4 Prompt | GPT-4 Results | Gemini Ultra Results |
    | ---- | ------- | ------- | ---- |
    | MMLU | Medprompt+ | 90.10% | 90.04% |
    ```
    *   **aml-tutorial/run_experiment.py - Pipeline Definition:** Shows the creation of an AzureML pipeline composed of reusable components.
    ```python
    @dsl.pipeline()
    def basic_pipeline(guidance_program_input, dataset_input) -> Pipeline:
        guidance_job = jsonl_guidance_aoai(
            guidance_program=guidance_program_input,
            # ... component parameters ...
        )
        # ... score_job definition ...
    ```

**2. "Prompt Portfolio" Approach Details**

*   **Answer:** The "Prompt Portfolio" approach, referred to as `Medprompt+` in the README, extends the core MedPrompt methodology by dynamically selecting between different prompting strategies based on question characteristics.  Specifically, for MMLU, it adds a portfolio of "simple, direct few-shot prompts" alongside the classic MedPrompt (Chain-of-Thought). The system uses a screening call to GPT-4 to determine if a question "requires a scratch-pad" (indicating complexity and need for CoT).  Based on this assessment, the contribution of either the CoT component or the direct few-shot prompts is dynamically adjusted in the ensemble. This aims to optimize performance across the diverse question types within MMLU, using simpler prompts for factual queries and more complex CoT prompts for reasoning-heavy questions.

*   **Evidence & References:**
    *   **README.md - "`Medprompt+` | Extending the power of prompting" section:**  Explicitly describes the "prompt portfolio" approach as an extension of MedPrompt. Explains the motivation for this extension: to handle the diversity of MMLU questions and improve performance on simpler, factual queries.
    *   **README.md - Code Block Example in "`Medprompt+`" section:** Shows the prompt used for the screening call to GPT-4 to decide whether a question requires a "scratch-pad".
    ```
    # Question
    {{ question }}

    # Task
    Does answering the question above require a scratch-pad?
    A. Yes
    B. No
    ```
    *   **README.md - "MMLU Accuracy Ablation" Image:**  Visually demonstrates the performance improvement achieved by MedPrompt+ over MedPrompt, highlighting the effectiveness of the portfolio approach.

*   **Code Snippets:**
    *   **README.md - Description of Medprompt+ Logic:** Illustrates the dynamic adjustment based on the screening call's output.
    ```
    If GPT-4 thinks the question does require a scratch-pad, then the contribution of the Chain-of-Thought component of the ensemble is doubled. If it doesn't, we halve that contribution (and let the ensemble instead depend more on the direct few-shot prompts).
    ```

**3. MedPrompt Core Components - Implementation Details**

*   **Answer:** MedPrompt, as implemented in this repository and described in the README, composes three core prompting strategies: **Dynamic Few-Shot Selection**, **Self-Generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**, and **Choice-Shuffle Ensembling (Majority Vote Ensembling)**. The implementation details are primarily located within the `src/promptbase/mmlu` directory, specifically in files like `knn_retriever.py`, `prompt_templates.py`, `eval.py`, and potentially `experiment.py` and `generate.py`.

*   **Evidence & References:**
    *   **README.md - "`Medprompt` and The Power of Prompting" section:**  Clearly lists and describes the three core components of MedPrompt: Dynamic Few Shots, Self-Generated Chain of Thought (CoT), and Majority Vote Ensembling.

Functions like `retrieve_knn_examples` (hypothetical name) might exist in such files.
    *   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Prompt templates for CoT are likely stored in `src/promptbase/mmlu/prompt_templates.py` or within prompt construction logic in files like `src/promptbase/mmlu/generate.py` or `src/promptbase/mmlu/experiment.py`. Look for files with "cot" or "prompt_template" in their names within `src/promptbase/mmlu`.
    *   **Self-Consistency Ensembling & Choice-Shuffle:**  Implementation might be in `src/promptbase/mmlu/eval.py` or potentially in `src/promptbase/mmlu/experiment.py` or `src/promptbase/mmlu/generate.py`. Look for logic related to running prompts multiple times with variations (choice shuffling) and aggregating results (majority voting) in these files.

**4. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection - Implementation Details**

*   **Answer:**  Based on the README and file structure, Dynamic Few-Shot Selection is likely implemented using a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach in embedding space. The process likely involves:
    1.  **Embedding Creation:** Training examples and test questions are embedded using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model. This might be done using components like `jsonl_embeddings_aoai_component.yaml` (inferred from `azureml/components`).
    2.  **k-NN Retrieval:** For each test question, the k-nearest neighbors are retrieved from the training set based on cosine similarity in the embedding space.  This retrieval logic is probably in `src/promptbase/mmlu/knn_retriever.py` and potentially utilizes components like `jsonl_knn_cosine_similarity_component.yaml` (inferred from `azureml/components`).
    3.  **Prompt Construction:** The retrieved k-nearest neighbor examples are then incorporated into the prompt for the test question as few-shot examples.

*   **Evidence & References:**
    *   **README.md - "Dynamic Few Shots" section:**  Describes the dynamic few-shot selection mechanism using k-NN clustering in embedding space. Mentions using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model for embedding and k-NN for retrieval.

    *   **azureml/components/jsonl_embeddings_aoai_component.yaml:**  Suggests the use of Azure OpenAI embeddings (likely `text-embedding-ada-002`) within the AzureML pipeline, possibly for pre-computing embeddings.
    *   **azureml/components/jsonl_knn_cosine_similarity_component.yaml:**  Indicates a component for k-NN cosine similarity calculations, likely used to retrieve similar examples.

*   **Code Snippets & Inferences (Based on file names and README descriptions):**
    *   **Embedding:** Code for generating embeddings likely resides in `src/promptbase/mmlu/embed_problems.py` or potentially in a dedicated embedding module within `src/promptbase/mmlu`. The component `src/azureml/components/src/jsonl_embeddings_aoai.py` likely implements the embedding generation logic using Azure OpenAI API.
    *   **k-NN Retrieval:**  The file `src/promptbase/mmlu/knn_retriever.py` (inferred) is the most likely place to find the code implementing the k-NN retrieval algorithm and functions like `retrieve_knn_examples` (hypothetical function name). The component `src/azureml/components/src/jsonl_knn_cosine_similarity.py` likely implements the core cosine similarity and k-NN logic used in the AzureML pipeline.

**5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting - Implementation Details**

*   **Answer:** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in MedPrompt is implemented using "Self-Generated Chain of Thought".  The repository likely utilizes prompt templates to guide GPT-4 to generate CoTs for training examples. The process probably involves:
    1.  **CoT Generation Prompts:** Prompt templates, possibly in `src/promptbase/mmlu/prompt_templates.py`, are used to instruct GPT-4 to generate chain-of-thought reasoning for training questions. These prompts might include phrases like "Let's think step by step".
    2.  **Automated CoT Creation:**  GPT-4 is called with these CoT generation prompts to automatically create CoT examples for the training dataset.
    3.  **Integration into Prompts:** The generated CoT examples are then used as few-shot examples when prompting GPT-4 for test questions, encouraging it to also use CoT reasoning.

*   **Evidence & References:**
    *   **README.md - "Self-Generated Chain of Thought (CoT)" section:**  Explains the approach of automating CoT generation using GPT-4 instead of relying on human experts.

    *   **azureml/pipelines/azureml_pipelines.py - `create_zeroshot_cot_pipeline` function:**  Shows the creation of an AzureML pipeline for Zero-Shot CoT, indicating the importance of CoT in the repository's prompting strategies.

*   **Code Snippets & Inferences (Based on file names and README descriptions):**
    *   **CoT Prompt Templates:**  Look for files like `src/promptbase/mmlu/prompt_templates.py` that might contain templates for CoT prompting.  These templates would likely include instructions to "think step by step". Example prompt templates might be named like `cot_prompt_template.txt` (hypothetical).
    *   **CoT Generation Logic:**  Code for generating CoT examples automatically might be within `src/promptbase/mmlu/generate.py` or `src/promptbase/mmlu/experiment.py`.  The guidance program examples in `guidance_programs/` directory could also provide clues.

**6. Self-Consistency Ensembling - Implementation Details**

*   **Answer:** Self-Consistency Ensembling in MedPrompt is implemented using a majority voting approach combined with choice shuffling. The process likely involves:
    1.  **Multiple Prompt Variations:** For each test question, multiple prompts are generated, possibly using variations in temperature or, more specifically, choice shuffling.
    2.  **Choice Shuffling:** The order of answer choices is shuffled for each prompt variation to increase ensemble diversity.
    3.  **Multiple LLM Calls:** GPT-4 is called multiple times (e.g., 5 or 20 times in MedPrompt and MedPrompt+) with these different prompt variations.
    4.  **Majority Vote:** The responses from these multiple calls are collected, and the most frequent answer is selected as the final answer using a majority vote.  This aims to improve the robustness and accuracy of the final prediction.

*   **Evidence & References:**
    *   **README.md - "Majority Vote Ensembling" section:**  Explains the use of ensembling, choice shuffling, and majority voting to improve performance.  Mentions using "a variety of prompts, or a single prompt with varied `temperature`".
