# Testing Report: Maritime Logistics Case Generator Pipeline

## Executive Summary

This report documents our testing approach for the Maritime Logistics Case Generator pipeline. We encountered challenges with mocking external dependencies, particularly Google's Gemini API. While we successfully implemented unit tests for individual components, our integration tests revealed issues with dependency mocking that need to be addressed.

## Test Results

| Test Name | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| test_full_pipeline_run | ❌ Failed | Google API authentication, mocks not working |
| test_pipeline_resume | ❌ Failed | Google API authentication, mocks not working |
| test_pipeline_error_handling | ❌ Failed | Mocks not called as expected |
| test_log_stage_error | ✅ Passed | Successfully tests error logging |
| test_save_final_case | ✅ Passed | Successfully tests case saving |

## Key Testing Challenges

### 1. LLM API Mocking

The primary challenge we faced was properly mocking the Gemini LLM API calls:

```
❌ ERROR IN DRAFT_GENERATION: Text generation failed after 3 attempts: 
  No API_KEY or ADC found. Please either:
    - Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.
    - Manually pass the key with `genai.configure(api_key=my_api_key)`.
    - Or set up Application Default Credentials
```

Despite applying patches to `src.utils.llm.generate_text`, the actual Google API client still attempted to authenticate, indicating our patching approach didn't completely isolate the test environment.

### 2. Module Import Issues

Our attempts to patch `google.generativeai` directly encountered issues with module imports:

```python
with patch.dict('sys.modules', {'google.generativeai': MagicMock()}):
    result = run_case_generation_pipeline(debug=True, save_checkpoints=True)
```

The approach didn't fully prevent real API calls because the Google client was already imported when the tests ran.

### 3. Mock Verification Failures

The error handling test showed that our mocks weren't being called as expected:

```
AssertionError: Expected 'select_random_example' to have been called once. Called 0 times.
```

This indicates an issue with our patching strategy or the pipeline's internal flow.

## Testing Strategy Revisions

### Unit vs Integration Testing

We've learned that our approach needs to distinguish more clearly between:

1. **Unit Tests**: These should use aggressive mocking to isolate components and have no external dependencies.

2. **Integration Tests**: These should be configured to use real dependencies when needed, with proper environment setup.

### Improved Mocking Approach

For effective unit testing, we need to:

1. **Patch at Module Level**: Intercept imports before they occur
2. **Mock All External Dependencies**: Including database and file operations
3. **Use Environment Variables**: Set up test-specific API configurations

### Handling External Dependencies

For the Google API specifically:

1. Create a mock implementation of the entire Gemini client
2. Override the module import path in tests
3. Provide fixture-based configuration

## Recommended Path Forward

### Short-term Fixes

1. **Environment Variable Setup**: Create a `.env.test` file with mock credentials for tests

```
# .env.test
GOOGLE_API_KEY=mock_api_key_for_testing
```

2. **Test-specific LLM Module**: Create a test-specific implementation that simulates responses

```python
# tests/mocks/llm_mock.py
class MockGeminiModel:
    def generate_content(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return MockResponse("This is a mock response")
        
# Use this in tests
```

3. **Import Patching Strategy**: Apply patches at the earliest point possible

```python
# Apply patch before any imports
patch_target = 'src.utils.llm.genai.GenerativeModel'
with patch(patch_target) as mock_model:
    mock_model.return_value.generate_content.return_value = mock_response
    # Run tests
```

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Separate Integration Test Suite**: Create integration tests that can be run separately and require API keys

2. **Test Configuration Management**: Create a test configuration system that can switch between real and mocked components

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Adaptation**: Set up CI/CD to run unit tests frequently but integration tests less often

4. **Dependency Injection**: Refactor code to use dependency injection to make testing easier

## Conclusion

Our testing approach needs refinement to effectively test the pipeline without depending on external services. While our basic test structure is sound, we need to improve our mocking strategy to fully isolate components during unit testing.

Moving forward, we'll implement a dual testing strategy: unit tests with comprehensive mocking for frequent runs and integration tests with real dependencies for less frequent verification.
