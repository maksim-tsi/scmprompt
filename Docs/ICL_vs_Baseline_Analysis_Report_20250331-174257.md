**Subject:** Evaluation of In-Context Learning Effectiveness for Complex Reasoning Tasks in Maritime Logistics

**1. Executive Summary**

This report details a comparative study evaluating the effectiveness of In-Context Learning (ICL) against a baseline approach for generating solutions to maritime logistics case studies using the Gemma-3-27b-it large language model (LLM). The baseline approach involved standard prompting of the LLM, while the ICL approach augmented the prompts with examples of similar, previously solved cases. Solution quality was assessed by an independent LLM judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) across three dimensions: Logical Soundness, Explanatory Quality, and Structure Clarity, each rated on a 10-point scale.

The results demonstrate a clear advantage for the ICL approach. While both methods produced logically sound and well-structured outputs (average scores > 8.3 and > 9.3 respectively), ICL significantly outperformed the baseline in Explanatory Quality, achieving an average score of 8.43 compared to the baseline's 7.20 (+1.23 points). This substantial improvement drove the overall average score for ICL to 8.81, compared to 8.27 for the baseline (+0.55 points). Furthermore, head-to-head comparisons across 44 case studies revealed that the ICL approach produced the superior solution in 68.18% of cases, compared to only 9.09% for the baseline, with 22.73% resulting in ties. These findings strongly suggest that ICL is a highly effective technique for enhancing the reasoning and explanatory capabilities of LLMs like Gemma-3-27b-it when applied to complex, domain-specific tasks such as maritime logistics problem-solving.

**2. Introduction**

Maritime logistics represents a cornerstone of global trade, characterized by intricate operational challenges, complex decision-making processes, and the need for robust, well-reasoned solutions. Case studies within this domain often involve multifaceted scenarios requiring analysis of shipping routes, port operations, vessel scheduling, cargo handling, regulatory compliance, and risk management. The advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to automate or augment the process of analyzing these case studies and generating potential solutions.

However, generating high-quality solutions requires more than just factual recall; it demands logical coherence, clear articulation of reasoning, and a well-structured presentation. Standard LLM prompting (the baseline approach) relies on the model's pre-trained knowledge and instruction-following capabilities. While often effective, the quality and style of the output can be variable, potentially lacking the specific nuances or depth of explanation desired for complex domains.

In-Context Learning (ICL) offers an alternative paradigm. By providing the LLM with a few examples (shots) of relevant task demonstrations within the prompt itself, ICL aims to guide the model's behavior at inference time without updating its underlying parameters. The hypothesis is that these examples help the model better understand the desired output format, reasoning style, level of detail, and domain-specific considerations pertinent to the task at hand.

This study was conducted to empirically compare the effectiveness of an ICL approach against a standard baseline approach for solving maritime logistics case studies using the Gemma-3-27b-it model. The primary objective was to quantify the impact of ICL on the quality of generated solutions, specifically focusing on the logical soundness, explanatory depth, and structural clarity of the reasoning presented. Understanding the relative performance of these approaches is crucial for optimizing the application of LLMs in specialized, high-stakes domains like maritime logistics.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1. Core Language Model:**
The study utilized Gemma-3-27b-it, a sophisticated instruction-tuned language model known for its strong reasoning and text generation capabilities. The same base model was used for both the baseline and ICL conditions to ensure a fair comparison, isolating the effect of the prompting strategy.

**3.2. Experimental Conditions:**
*   **Baseline Approach:** Case studies were presented to Gemma-3-27b-it using standard prompts designed to elicit a reasoned solution. These prompts contained the case study description and a direct instruction to analyze the situation and propose a solution, but included no illustrative examples.
*   **ICL Approach:** For each case study presented to Gemma-3-27b-it, the prompt included not only the case description and instruction but also one or more examples of *different* but *similar* maritime logistics case studies along with their high-quality solutions. These examples served as demonstrations of the desired reasoning process, explanatory style, and output structure. The selection of "similar" cases was based on thematic relevance to the target case study.

**3.3. Evaluation Framework:**
To ensure objective and consistent assessment, an independent LLM judge, Gemini 2.5 Pro, was employed. This advanced LLM was tasked with evaluating the quality of the solutions generated by both the baseline and ICL approaches for each case study.

*   **Evaluation Criteria:** The LLM judge assessed each solution based on three predefined dimensions:
    1.  **Reasoning Logical Soundness:** The degree to which the arguments presented are logically coherent, internally consistent, and free from contradictions. (Scale: 1-10)
    2.  **Reasoning Explanatory Quality:** The clarity, depth, and persuasiveness with which the solution explains the rationale behind its conclusions, assumptions, and proposed actions. (Scale: 1-10)
    3.  **Reasoning Structure Clarity:** The organization, flow, and ease of comprehension of the presented reasoning. This includes aspects like clear headings, logical sequencing of points, and overall readability. (Scale: 1-10)

*   **Scoring and Comparison:** For each case study, the LLM judge assigned scores (1-10) for each of the three dimensions to both the baseline and ICL solutions. Average scores across all cases were calculated for each metric and approach. Additionally, the judge performed a head-to-head comparison for each case, determining whether the ICL solution was superior, the baseline solution was superior, or if they were of comparable quality (a tie).

**3.4. Dataset:**
The evaluation was conducted on a set of 44 distinct maritime logistics case studies, covering a range of typical scenarios encountered in the industry.

**4. Results Analysis**

The quantitative results reveal a consistent and significant advantage for the ICL approach over the baseline.

**4.1. Average Score Performance:**

| Metric                | Baseline Score | ICL Score | Absolute Improvement | Relative Improvement (%) |
| :-------------------- | :------------- | :-------- | :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Logical Soundness     | 8.30           | 8.45      | 0.16                 | 1.9%                     |
| Explanatory Quality   | 7.20           | 8.43      | 1.23                 | 17.1%                    |
| Structure Clarity     | 9.30           | 9.55      | 0.25                 | 2.7%                     |
| **Average Score**     | **8.27**       | **8.81**  | **0.55**             | **6.6%**                 |

*   **Logical Soundness:** Both approaches achieved high scores, indicating that the base Gemma model is capable of generating logically coherent arguments. The ICL approach showed a marginal improvement (+0.16 points), suggesting it may help refine the consistency or rigor of the logic slightly, perhaps by demonstrating preferred argumentation patterns.
*   **Explanatory Quality:** This metric exhibited the most dramatic difference. The ICL approach achieved a score of 8.43, a substantial increase of 1.23 points (or 17.1%) over the baseline's 7.20. This indicates that providing examples significantly enhances the model's ability to articulate *why* certain conclusions are reached, improving the depth, clarity, and persuasiveness of the explanation. This was the primary driver of the overall performance difference.
*   **Structure Clarity:** Both methods produced highly structured outputs, with baseline scores
