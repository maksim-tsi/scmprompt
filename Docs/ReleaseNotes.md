# Release Notes - Maritime Logistics Knowledge Base

This document tracks the key changes, improvements, and fixes in each release of our Maritime Logistics Knowledge Base project.

# Release 0.8.1 - Examples Notebook Enhancement (July 19, 2025)

## üöÄ New Features
- **Enhanced Examples Notebook**: Complete overhaul of `examples.ipynb` to work with generated maritime logistics cases

- **Improved Data Loading**: Switched from textbook examples to AI-generated training cases from `train_cases.parquet`

## üõ†Ô∏è Improvements
- **Data Source Migration**: Updated notebook to use generated maritime logistics cases instead of static textbook examples
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added comprehensive pandas Series and numpy array handling for case export
- **Simplified File Naming**: Streamlined exported file names to use only case IDs for clarity
- **Enhanced Case Analysis**: Added quality metrics analysis, qualification status, and case length statistics
- **Better Fallback Search**: Improved local search functionality when vector database is unavailable

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed malformed JSON syntax in notebook cells that prevented proper execution
- Resolved numpy array handling issues in text file export functionality
- Fixed empty file generation problem in case export feature
- Corrected string conversion errors for mixed data types

## üìù Technical Details
- **File Format**: Case exports saved as `.txt` files in `/Data/GeneratedCases/txt/` directory
- **Data Processing**: Added `safe_get_value()` function for robust pandas data extraction
- **Quality Metrics**: Display realism scores, complexity scores, and educational value for cases
- **Content Structure**: Exported files include case scenario, solution, quality metrics, and evaluation summaries

## üìä Example Workflow Demonstrated
1. Load 245 generated maritime logistics cases from parquet file
2. Analyze case quality metrics and qualification status
3. Export sample cases with full details for review
4. Demonstrate few-shot prompt construction using real cases
5. Show vector database search with local fallback capability

# Previous Project: Magdeburg25 v0.7.0 (Legacy)

## Maritime Logistics Case Generation and Solution Assistant

This release provided a complete implementation of the Magdeburg25 system for maritime logistics case generation and solutions using advanced AI techniques. The current project, scmprompt, is a direct evolution and rebranding of this work.

### Key Features

#### Case Generation Pipeline
- Multi-stage processing with separate analytical phases
- Integration with domain-specific datapoints
- Enhancement with realistic scenarios and challenges

#### In-Context Learning System
- Semantic retrieval of similar cases using embeddings
- Dynamic example selection for improved solutions
- MedPrompt-inspired approach for case solving

#### Vector Database Integration
- Qdrant integration for semantic search
- Efficient storage of cases and solutions

- Pre-populated with 300+ maritime logistics examples

#### Evaluation Framework
- Quality metrics for case realism, complexity, and educational value
- Automated assessment using LLM as judge
- Case filtering based on quality criteria

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Version 0.5.0 (March 27, 2025)

### Summary

Our first official release establishes the core infrastructure and data processing pipeline, with a focus on normalized entity representation and vector search capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Entity Name Normalization**: Standardized 500+ entity names down to ~150 canonical forms for improved search consistency
- **Vector Database Integration**: Implemented Qdrant Cloud for persistent, shareable vector storage
- **Datapoint Processing Pipeline**: Established workflow for processing, normalizing, and vectorizing structured data
- **Search Capabilities**: Added semantic search with filtering by port, entity, keywords, and other attributes

### Detailed Changes

#### Data Processing

- Created entity normalization pipeline with mapping dictionary
- Implemented standardized naming conventions for entity types
- Added plurality normalization (e.g., "Shippers" ‚Üí "Shipper")
- Normalized case inconsistencies (e.g., "CUSTOMER" ‚Üí "Customer")
- Grouped synonymous terms (e.g., "Client" ‚Üí "Customer")
- Standardized compound entities (e.g., "Vessels in Narrow Channels" ‚Üí "Vessel")

#### Infrastructure

- Integrated with Qdrant Cloud for vector storage
- Added UUID conversion for consistent point identification
- Created robust data loading with progress tracking and error handling
- Implemented embedding generation with Google's text-embedding-004

#### Search & Retrieval

- Created utils module for standardized search operations
- Implemented entity filtering with normalized names
- Added multi-filter search capabilities
- Developed Jupyter notebooks for testing and demonstration
- Built rich result display formatting

### Known Issues

- Minor discrepancy between total datapoints loaded (1346) and final collection count (1345) suggests possible duplicate handling
- Search response times may vary due to cloud API latency

### Next Steps

- Implement domain-specific search templates for common use cases
- Add multi-entity relationship exploration
- Improve performance monitoring and analytics
- Develop export functionality for search results
