### Next Steps - Actionable Plan Moving Forward:

Based on your excellent analysis of the Promptbase repository, our finalized research plan, and the formatting guidelines, here's a concrete and actionable plan to move into **Phase 2: System Design and Development:**

**Phase 2: System Design and Development - Action Plan**

**(Timeline: Estimated 3-4 Months - aiming for a functional prototype and system design document by the end of this phase)**

    - **Action 1.6: Implement Core LLM Assistant Functionality (Python & Guidance):**
        
        - Start implementing the core Python logic for your LLM assistant, focusing on:
            
            - Loading SCM scenario data (initially, use simulated or simplified data for rapid prototyping - real data integration can come later).
                
            - Calling the LLM API (using guidance) with your initial MedPrompt-inspired prompting strategy (focus on CoT and dynamic few-shot first, defer ensembling for the very initial prototype if needed to simplify).
                
            - Generating and displaying basic recommendations/plans in the Streamlit UI.
                
    - **Action 1.7: Implement MedPrompt-Inspired Domain Adaptation (Dynamic Few-Shot):**

        - Set up a basic vector database (Pinecone Free Tier is a good starting point).
            
        - Create a small initial dataset of SCM examples (scenario descriptions and recommendations) to populate your vector database for testing dynamic retrieval.
            
        - Implement the retrieve_knn_examples_from_vectorDB function (or similar) to query your vector database and fetch dynamic few-shot examples.

        - Consider using:
            
            - **Simulated SCM Scenarios:** Create simulated logistics scenarios with varying conditions (disruptions, demand fluctuations, etc.). PlaSMA or other simulation tools (even simplified Python-based simulations) could be explored later for more complex scenarios, but for now, well-defined textual descriptions of scenarios might be sufficient for initial evaluation.
                
            - **Simplified Real-World Data (if accessible and ethical):** If you can access anonymized and simplified real-world logistics data (e.g., historical shipment data, anonymized port congestion data), you could use this to create more realistic evaluation scenarios.
                
            - **Focus on Task-Specific Relevance and Measurability for Benchmarks.**
                
        - **Document your chosen evaluation metrics and benchmarks/scenarios in a Preliminary Evaluation Plan Document.**
            

**Timeline Summary for Phase 2:**

- **Month 1:** System Architecture Design, Initial Prototype (Core Functionality & Dynamic Few-Shot).
    
- **Month 2:** Prototype Enhancement (Ensembling, CoT), Detailed System Design Document (Draft 1).
