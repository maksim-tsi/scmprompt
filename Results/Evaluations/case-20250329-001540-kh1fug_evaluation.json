    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively addressing the core issues of the scenario. Its reasoning follows a clear progression from immediate crisis management to long-term strategy, although the explanatory depth for the necessity of certain actions could be slightly enhanced.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 7,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure using Immediate, Short-Term, Medium-Term, and Long-Term phases, making the plan easy to follow.",
      "Logically sound sequence of actions, starting with information gathering and moving towards mitigation and strategic changes.",
      "Correctly identifies and prioritizes key actions like real-time tracking, demurrage assessment, and evaluating alternative ports.",
      "Directly addresses the specific questions posed in the scenario.",
      "Clear and concise language used throughout the response."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While actions are logical, the explanation for *why* certain steps are critical (e.g., the specific risks of invalid customs declarations beyond needing amendments) is less detailed compared to the ground truth.",
      "Less explicit linkage between proposed actions and specific constraints or data points mentioned in the scenario (e.g., DATAPOINTS, specific regulations like ISPS code, although the concepts are covered).",
      "The reasoning for contract review being placed solely in the medium-term could be debated, as understanding immediate liabilities (as per ground truth) is also crucial."

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-reasoned and logically structured response to the complex logistics scenario. Its reasoning was sound, clearly explained, and presented in an exceptionally organized manner, closely aligning with the ground truth's approach.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 9,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10

    "strengths": [
      "The reasoning follows a logical progression from immediate assessment to long-term strategy.",
      "Each step includes a clear 'Reasoning' section that effectively justifies the proposed actions based on the scenario's context.",
      "The structure is exceptionally clear, using numbered steps, distinct action/reasoning components, and priority levels, making it very easy to follow.",
      "The reasoning directly addresses the core problems outlined in the scenario, such as delays, costs, and stakeholder management.",
      "The assistant correctly identifies the need to evaluate alternatives and review contracts as logical consequences of the delays."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 'Regulatory Reference' provided for Step 1 ('best practices') is less specific and convincing compared to the ground truth's reference to SOLAS.",
      "Minor factual error in the title ('Nordic Breeze' instead of 'Aurora Borealis'), though this doesn't significantly impact the reasoning quality itself.",
      "The reference to 'DAP Incoterms' in Step 1 is an assumption not explicitly stated in the scenario description."
