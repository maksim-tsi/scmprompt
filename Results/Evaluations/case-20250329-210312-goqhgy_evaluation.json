  "baseline_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a logically sound and exceptionally well-structured response that addresses the core issues of the scenario. While the reasoning is generally clear, it lacks the explanatory depth and explicit linkage to specific scenario details or regulations found in the ground truth.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 7,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure using Immediate, Medium, and Long-Term phases, enhancing clarity.",
      "Logical prioritization of immediate actions, focusing on the critical dangerous goods issue and port delays.",
      "Reasoning steps follow logically from the identified problems in the scenario.",
      "Comprehensive coverage of different aspects of the problem (operational, communication, regulatory, strategic).",
      "Clear and professional language used throughout the response."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Explanations for proposed actions, while present, lack depth compared to the ground truth.",
      "Reasoning does not always explicitly connect actions back to specific scenario facts or regulatory requirements (e.g., specific IMDG code references mentioned in the ground truth are absent).",
      "The 'why' behind some suggestions is implied rather than explicitly stated, reducing explanatory conviction."
    ]

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant demonstrated excellent reasoning quality, effectively interpreting the scenario and proposing a logically sound, well-explained, and clearly structured solution that aligns closely with the ground truth.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 9,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10
    },
    "strengths": [
      "The reasoning follows a highly logical progression, directly addressing the multifaceted problems presented in the scenario.",
      "The phased approach (Immediate, Medium-Term, Long-Term) provides an exceptionally clear and organized structure for the reasoning.",
      "Each proposed action is accompanied by a clear 'Reasoning' section that effectively explains the 'why' behind the action, linking it directly to the scenario's facts and challenges.",
      "Prioritization of actions (e.g., DG declaration) is logical and well-justified within the reasoning.",
      "Appropriate references to relevant regulations (IMDG Code) are integrated into the reasoning, strengthening the justification for specific actions."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While the reasoning for *why* the DG declaration needs fixing is excellent, the explanation could have slightly more explicitly stated *what* specific information was missing based on the scenario description (though this is a minor point as the core reasoning remains sound)."
