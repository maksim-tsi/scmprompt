    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-reasoned and exceptionally structured solution, logically addressing the scenario's challenges with strong explanatory detail and clear links to the provided context.",

    "strengths": [
      "Excellent organization using phases (Immediate, Medium, Long-Term), clear action steps, and a problem breakdown table enhances readability.",
      "Strong explanatory quality, clearly linking proposed actions (e.g., port diversification, B/L verification) to specific problems (e.g., congestion, customs issues) and scenario details, including explicit references to datapoints.",
      "Logically sound recommendations that directly address the core issues presented in the scenario.",
      "Explicit consideration of costs and risks associated with each recommended action.",
      "Clear identification and integration of regulatory constraints mentioned in the scenario (ISPS Code, BMEL regulations).",
      "The phased implementation approach provides a practical and logical roadmap."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While recommending Rotterdam is logical, the reasoning could be slightly enhanced by briefly explaining why it might be preferred over other mentioned alternatives like Bremerhaven, beyond just stating it has higher capacity and less congestion.",
      "The specific recommendation to shift '30-40%' of shipments appears somewhat arbitrary without explicit supporting analysis within the answer itself, although acceptable for a high-level strategic plan."

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-reasoned and highly structured solution that directly addresses the core problems outlined in the scenario. The reasoning for each proposed step is logically sound, clearly explained, and effectively linked back to the scenario's details, demonstrating a strong understanding of the business case.",

    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure and clarity, using headings, bullet points, and distinct sections (Action, Reasoning, etc.) effectively.",
      "Strong logical connection between the identified problems in the scenario (congestion, costs, data errors) and the proposed solution steps.",
      "Clear and explicit explanations provided within the 'Reasoning' section for each action, justifying the chosen approach based on scenario facts.",
      "Effectively incorporates and references specific regulatory constraints mentioned in the scenario (e.g., ISPS Code, EU Customs, BMEL) within the reasoning.",
      "The phased approach (immediate, short-term, ongoing) demonstrates logical planning."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While regulatory references are included, some are slightly generic (e.g., Port State Control) and not directly tied to a specific problem *stated* in the scenario, although contextually relevant.",
      "Some specific quantitative suggestions (e.g., diverting 30-40% of shipments) lack explicit justification derived solely from the scenario text, appearing somewhat arbitrary despite being plausible."
