    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a logically sound and exceptionally well-structured response, effectively addressing the core issues of the scenario. While the reasoning was internally consistent and the proposed actions were relevant, the explanatory quality could be enhanced by providing more explicit justifications for *why* specific actions are expected to yield results based on scenario facts.",

    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure and organization (Diagnosis, Pillars, Actions, Risks, KPIs, etc.), making the reasoning easy to follow.",
      "Strong logical connection between the identified problems (container shortage, port delays, regulations) and the proposed solutions (diversification, negotiation, optimization).",
      "Prioritization of issues and actions (e.g., Critical, High Priority) demonstrates sound strategic reasoning.",
      "Comprehensive coverage of the different facets of the problem described in the scenario.",
      "The reasoning is internally consistent, with no major logical flaws or contradictions."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reasoning lacks depth in explaining the causal links between proposed actions and expected outcomes; it often states *what* to do but not fully *why* it will solve the specific scenario problem (e.g., doesn't explicitly state *how* rail to Gdansk mitigates the specific Klaipeda/OceanWave issues beyond the implicit understanding).",
      "Explanations for recommendations are less detailed compared to the ground truth, relying more on implication rather than explicit justification based on scenario details."

    "strengths": [
      "Explicit 'Reasoning' section for each step clearly justifies the proposed actions based on scenario facts.",
      "Logical flow between identifying problems (congestion, shortages, inspections) and proposing specific, relevant solutions (diversification, negotiation, process optimization).",
      "Excellent organization and structure enhance readability and understanding of the reasoning process.",
      "Good integration of regulatory aspects within the reasoning for relevant steps.",
      "The reasoning directly addresses multiple facets of the complex problem described in the scenario."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reasoning, while sound, missed prioritizing immediate customer communication, a logical first step in mitigating reputational damage mentioned in the scenario.",
      "While alternatives like rail are logically proposed, the reasoning doesn't explicitly acknowledge potential complexities or trade-offs (e.g., cost, capacity) as deeply as it could.",
      "The reasoning behind the specific budget figures provided in the timeline is absent, making them seem arbitrary rather than logically derived from the proposed actions."
