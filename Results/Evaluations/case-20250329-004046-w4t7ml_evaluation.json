    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-reasoned and logically structured contingency plan, effectively addressing the core challenges presented in the scenario with clear explanations for its proposed actions.",

      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 8,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure using clear phases (Assessment, Analysis, Implementation, Monitoring) and timelines.",
      "Logically sound sequence of actions, starting with assessment and communication, moving to analysis, implementation, and monitoring.",
      "Effectively identifies and addresses all key problem areas mentioned in the scenario (routing, costs, delays, contracts, communication, customs).",
      "Provides clear explanations for *why* specific actions are necessary (e.g., reviewing ENS to avoid penalties, assessing routes based on cost/time/risk).",
      "Reasoning consistently links proposed actions back to the facts and constraints presented in the scenario description.",
      "The breakdown into actionable steps within each phase is practical and easy to follow."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While explanations are generally good, they could occasionally be slightly more detailed regarding the specific impact or regulatory nuance (though it correctly identifies key elements like ENS and T1).",
      "The suggested timelines (e.g., 'Days 1-3') might be slightly optimistic given the complexity and potential for external delays inherent in logistics."

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively addressing the core challenges presented in the scenario. Its reasoning was clearly explained and directly tied to the scenario's facts and constraints.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 9,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure with clear, numbered steps and distinct sections for actions, reasoning, and regulatory references.",
      "Strong explanatory quality, with dedicated 'Reasoning' sections justifying each proposed action based on scenario constraints (e.g., time sensitivity, cost, compliance).",
      "Logically sound progression of steps, starting with immediate assessment and moving through transport selection, customs, and ongoing tasks like contract review and communication.",
      "Correctly identified key regulatory requirements (ENS amendment, potential T1 document, CMR, Incoterms relevance) and linked them appropriately to action steps."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While the reasoning for prioritizing rail was provided (balancing cost/speed), it contrasts with the ground truth's prioritization of trucking (flexibility), although both are plausible interpretations based solely on the scenario.",
      "The interpretation of DAP Incoterms regarding responsibility for arranging onward transport from Hamburg could be slightly nuanced, though the Assistant's approach is practical."
