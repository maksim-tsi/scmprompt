    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response that correctly identified and addressed the core issues from the scenario. However, the reasoning lacked depth in explaining the 'why' behind certain actions and explicitly linking them back to specific scenario details.",

      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 8,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 7,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 9

    "strengths": [
      "The reasoning follows a logical progression, addressing each key problem identified in the scenario.",
      "The phased approach (Immediate, Medium-Term, Long-Term) provides a logical framework for tackling the crisis.",
      "The structure is exceptionally clear, using distinct phases, problem categories, and bullet points, making the reasoning easy to follow.",
      "Proposed actions are generally consistent with the facts and challenges presented in the scenario description."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reasoning often states *what* should be done but lacks sufficient explanation for *why* a specific action is proposed or how it directly addresses the root cause described in the scenario (e.g., explaining the specific benefits of PCS beyond just 'investigating' it).",
      "While logically sound, the reasoning could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting proposed actions back to the specific details and consequences mentioned in the scenario (e.g., linking B/L audits directly to the stated EORI/weight issues causing delays for Nordic Electronics).",
      "Explanations for the effectiveness of certain measures (e.g., dedicated account managers) are sometimes superficial."

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively addressing the core issues presented in the scenario. The reasoning for each proposed action was clearly explained and directly linked to mitigating the identified problems, demonstrating good explanatory quality.",

      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 9,

    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure with clear headings and sub-points (Action, Reasoning, Implementation) making the reasoning process easy to follow.",
      "Strong logical connection between the identified problems (e.g., port congestion, container imbalance) and the proposed solutions (e.g., port diversification, incentives).",
      "Clear and explicit explanations provided for *why* each action is recommended, linking it back to scenario details.",
      "Comprehensive coverage of all major challenges outlined in the scenario.",
      "Inclusion of specific implementation steps adds practicality to the reasoning."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Some regulatory references (e.g., SOLAS for port diversification due to congestion) felt slightly stretched in their direct applicability, weakening the justification slightly.",
      "The reasoning for prioritizing Antwerp-Bruges relies on an assertion ('currently experiences less congestion') which, while plausible, isn't explicitly stated as a fact *within* the provided scenario description."
