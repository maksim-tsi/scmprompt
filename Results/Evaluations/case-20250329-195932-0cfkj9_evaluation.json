    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively addressing the core challenges outlined in the scenario. While the reasoning was generally clear, the explanatory quality could be enhanced by more explicitly linking proposed actions to the specific business risks and consequences mentioned in the case.",

      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 8,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 7,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 9
    },
    "strengths": [
      "The reasoning follows a logical progression, breaking down the complex problem into manageable phases (Strategy, Operations, Technology, Improvement).",
      "The operational plan is logically structured chronologically (Riga -> Rotterdam -> East Asia -> Arrival).",
      "Actions proposed generally align logically with the challenges presented in the scenario (e.g., temperature monitoring for spoilage risk, documentation for customs).",
      "The structure is exceptionally clear, using headings, sub-headings, and bullet points effectively, making the reasoning easy to follow.",
      "Correctly references specific datapoints from the scenario to support recommendations regarding documentation and regulatory compliance."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The initial justification for selecting a 'Hybrid Service' is somewhat assertive rather than deeply reasoned based on scenario specifics.",
      "While explanations for actions are provided, they could more strongly articulate the *consequences* of inaction or failure, linking directly back to the core risks (cost, delay, spoilage, customer satisfaction) outlined in the scenario.",
      "Some explanations state the 'what' and 'why' but lack depth in explaining the 'how' or the specific impact relative to alternatives (e.g., why independent loggers are significantly better than relying solely on the carrier's)."

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The assistant provided a logically sound and well-structured response, clearly explaining the reasoning behind most steps and addressing the core scenario challenges. However, the justification linking actions to specific regulations was sometimes weak or less precise compared to the ground truth.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 7,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 8,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 9
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Clear, logical structure with distinct phases (Planning, Implementation, Specialized) and steps.",
      "Consistent format within each step (Action, Regulation/Requirement, Reasoning), enhancing readability.",
      "Explicit reasoning provided for each proposed action, clearly linking it back to the scenario's challenges.",
      "Good coverage of the key operational challenges identified in the scenario description.",
      "The 'Reasoning' section effectively explains the 'why' behind each action."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Some regulatory justifications are generic (e.g., \"general principles of commercial law\", \"general principles of risk management\") lacking specificity.",
      "The link between certain actions and regulations is occasionally tenuous or less accurate than the ground truth (e.g., citing SOLAS/ISPS primarily for container availability in Step 1).",
      "Lacks the depth of specific regulatory references seen in the ground truth (e.g., Hamburg Rules, specific Japanese laws like Food Sanitation Act).",
      "Missed explicitly mentioning cargo insurance as a distinct mitigation step, which was included in the ground truth."
