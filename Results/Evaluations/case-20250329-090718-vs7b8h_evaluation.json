    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-reasoned and exceptionally structured response. Its logical flow is sound, clearly linking proposed actions to the scenario's challenges, and the phased approach significantly enhances clarity.",

      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 8,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of a phased structure (Immediate, Medium, Long-Term) which logically organizes the response.",
      "Strong logical connection between the identified problems in the scenario (delays, B/L error, reefer issues, compliance) and the proposed solutions.",
      "Clear identification of key stakeholders and the specific communication required with each.",
      "Effectively prioritizes immediate crisis management actions while also outlining necessary medium and long-term strategic improvements.",
      "The reasoning explicitly considers and references the EU regulations mentioned in the scenario.",
      "The overall reasoning demonstrates a solid understanding of the interconnected nature of the logistics challenges presented."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While generally good, the explanatory quality could be slightly enhanced by more explicitly linking *why* certain immediate actions (like fixing the B/L error *before* arrival) are critical based on specific scenario details (e.g., enabling pre-clearance to mitigate port delays).",
      "The reasoning for evaluating port diversion could more strongly emphasize the comparison between diversion costs/time vs. spoilage/penalty costs, although this is implicitly understood."

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively addressing the core issues presented in the scenario. Its reasoning was clearly explained and often referenced specific regulations mentioned in the case, demonstrating good adherence to the provided context.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 9,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10

    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure using a phased approach (Immediate, Medium, Long-term) which is logical for a business case.",
      "Steps are logically derived from the problems outlined in the scenario (e.g., addressing B/L discrepancy due to customs risk, contacting customer due to cancellation threat).",
      "Strong explanatory quality, with clear reasoning provided for each recommended action.",
      "Effectively references specific EU regulations mentioned in the scenario (e.g., EU 178/2002, EU 37/2005, Customs Regs) to justify actions, demonstrating good scenario adherence.",
      "The language is clear, professional, and easy to follow."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While logical, the immediate actions could have emphasized simultaneous contact with *all* key parties (like Captain Li) slightly more explicitly, as seen in the ground truth.",
      "The reasoning for the specific cost implications provided is not detailed, appearing as generic estimates rather than derived directly from scenario details (though providing precise costs is inherently difficult)."
