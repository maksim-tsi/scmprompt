    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively outlining a relevant contingency plan with clear reasoning for its proposed actions, closely aligning with the core challenges presented in the scenario.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 8,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 8,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 9
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure using phases and clear headings, making the reasoning easy to follow.",
      "Strong logical connection between the identified problems (delays, penalties) and the proposed mitigation steps (negotiation, alternative transport, customs coordination).",
      "Clearly explains the rationale behind key actions, such as prioritizing negotiation with the client for transparency and penalty mitigation.",
      "Effectively breaks down the complex situation into manageable action items.",
      "Correctly identifies the primary alternative (road transport) given the rail bottleneck."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The initial calculation of 'Total Potential Delay (ElectroGlobal)' incorrectly aggregates the feeder vessel delay, which primarily affects other clients, slightly impacting the initial logical framing, although this is implicitly corrected later.",
      "While generally good, the explanatory quality could be marginally improved by explicitly linking every single recommended action back to a specific constraint or goal mentioned in the scenario description."
    ]

  "icl_evaluation": {
    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively addressing the core challenges presented in the scenario. Its reasoning was generally clear and well-explained, although slightly less detailed in regulatory specifics and negotiation nuances compared to the ground truth.",
    "scores": {
      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 8,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 8,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 9
    },
    "strengths": [
      "The reasoning follows a clear, logical, phased approach (Immediate Actions, Contingency Planning, Execution) which aligns well with crisis management.",
      "The Assistant correctly identifies the key problems (congestion, rail capacity, feeder delay, contractual penalties) and proposes relevant actions.",
      "Each step includes a 'Reasoning' section, explicitly linking the proposed action back to the scenario's context (e.g., need for transparency, penalty mitigation, customs requirements).",
      "The reasoning considers multiple facets of the problem, including communication, alternative logistics, negotiation, and regulatory compliance.",
      "The structure is highly organized and easy to follow, enhancing the clarity of the proposed reasoning process."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While mentioning regulations (DAP Incoterms, EU customs), the reasoning lacks the specific regulatory citations present in the ground truth, making the justification slightly less robust.",
      "The reasoning behind negotiating *force majeure* for demurrage is mentioned but not deeply explored, simply noting it might be difficult without further justification based on scenario facts.",
      "The explanatory quality could be slightly improved by more explicitly linking the cost/benefit analysis of alternatives (road vs. rail vs. port diversion) back to the specific penalty structure (\u20ac10k/day) and grace period."
