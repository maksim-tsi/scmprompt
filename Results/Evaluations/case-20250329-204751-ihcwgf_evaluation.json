    "evaluation_summary": "The Assistant provided a well-structured and logically sound response, effectively addressing the core issues of the scenario with relevant actions. While the reasoning for individual actions could be more explicitly articulated, the overall plan is coherent, comprehensive, and clearly presented.",

      "reasoning_logical_soundness": 9,
      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 7,
      "reasoning_structure_clarity": 10
    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent organization and structure using clear sections (Exec Summary, Situation Analysis, Objectives, Action Plans, etc.) and tables.",
      "Logically sound connection between identified problems (congestion, delays, costs, information asymmetry) and proposed solutions (negotiation, rerouting, tech investment, etc.).",
      "Comprehensive coverage of both short-term mitigation and long-term strategies, aligning with the scenario requirements.",
      "Good integration of specific scenario details like entities (Krantas, ScanLogistics AB), regulations (Article 12, ISPS), and suggested actions (Riga rerouting, visibility tech).",
      "The inclusion of KPIs, risks, costs, responsibilities, and timelines within the action plan tables demonstrates structured reasoning."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The explicit reasoning explaining *why* each specific action is proposed and *how* it directly addresses a scenario problem or achieves an objective is often brief or implied within the action description, rather than being clearly articulated as a separate justification.",
      "Compared to the ground truth, the causal link between a specific action and its expected impact based on scenario facts is less explicitly detailed within the action plan itself."

    "evaluation_summary": "The assistant provided a well-reasoned and exceptionally structured response, logically addressing the core issues of the scenario with clear explanations linking actions to scenario facts and regulatory requirements.",

      "reasoning_explanatory_quality": 9,

    "strengths": [
      "Excellent structure using phases, steps, and clear Action/Reasoning sections.",
      "Strong logical connection between the identified problems in the scenario and the proposed actions.",
      "Clear explanations provided for *why* each action is proposed, directly referencing scenario issues (e.g., waiting times, customs bottlenecks, information asymmetry).",
      "Good integration of specific details from the scenario, such as Article 12, Datapoints 8, 12, 14, and key stakeholders.",
      "Appropriate referencing of regulatory requirements mentioned in the scenario (Klaipeda Port Authority regulations, Lithuanian customs law, ISPS Code) within the reasoning.",
      "The phased approach (Immediate, Medium, Long-Term) provides a logical progression for the solution."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Minor weakness: The compliance checklist included Hague-Visby/Hamburg Rules which, while relevant contextually to shipping, were not explicitly mentioned as core regulatory issues *within the provided scenario description*."
