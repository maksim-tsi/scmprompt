  "solution": "## Executive Summary\n\nBaltic Breeze Seafood faces a complex challenge balancing cost, speed, and regulatory compliance in its seafood import operations. Rising transportation costs, delays, temperature control issues, and documentation discrepancies threaten profitability and potentially jeopardize their import license. This solution proposes a phased approach: (1) a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the Rotterdam-Riga route versus the current Singapore-Riga route, factoring in Incoterms implications; (2) a robust temperature monitoring and documentation system leveraging data loggers and potentially blockchain; (3) supplier and freight forwarder negotiations focused on long-term contracts and performance-based clauses; (4) development of a supply chain resilience plan addressing potential disruptions; and (5) implementation of data quality controls and EDI for streamlined customs clearance. This comprehensive strategy aims to reduce costs, improve delivery times, ensure full EU regulatory compliance, and enhance supply chain resilience, securing Baltic Breeze Seafood\u2019s long-term success.\n\n## Detailed Solution Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Route Optimization & Cost-Benefit Analysis (6-8 weeks)**\n\n**Step 1: Detailed Cost Analysis \u2013 Singapore-Riga vs. Rotterdam-Riga**\n\n* **Action:** Conduct a granular cost analysis of both routes. This includes:\n    * **Singapore-Riga:** OceanEx freight (Baltic Mariner), Port of Riga charges (FPRA \u2013 including demurrage potential), inland transport from Riga port to warehouse, insurance, potential spoilage costs (historical data), administrative costs.\n    * **Rotterdam-Riga:** OceanEx freight to Rotterdam, Port of Rotterdam charges (including potential demurrage), short-sea shipping from Rotterdam to Riga (quotes from multiple carriers), inland transport from Riga port to warehouse, insurance, potential spoilage costs, administrative costs.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** EU Customs Code (Regulation (EU) No 952/2013) \u2013 impact of different Incoterms on customs duties and VAT.\n* **Reasoning:**  Provides a data-driven basis for route selection.  Identifies hidden costs associated with each option.\n* **Documentation Workflow:**\n    * Obtain detailed quotes from OceanEx for both routes.\n    * Gather port tariff information from FPRA and Port of Rotterdam.\n    * Obtain short-sea shipping quotes from at least three carriers.\n    * Develop a spreadsheet comparing total costs, transit times, and risks for each route.\n    * Analyze Incoterms (CIF Riga vs. DAP Rotterdam) and their impact on cost allocation and responsibility.  CIF Riga shifts more risk to the seller, while DAP Rotterdam shifts more risk to Baltic Breeze.\n\n**Step 2: Transit Time Analysis & Inventory Holding Costs**\n\n* **Action:**  Analyze historical transit times for both routes.  Calculate inventory holding costs associated with longer transit times (capital tied up, storage costs, potential obsolescence).\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 \u2013 shelf life requirements for different seafood products.\n* **Reasoning:**  Faster transit times reduce inventory holding costs and minimize the risk of spoilage.\n* **Documentation Workflow:**\n    * Review historical shipping data from OceanEx.\n    * Calculate inventory holding costs based on product value, storage costs, and estimated shelf life.\n    * Incorporate inventory holding costs into the overall cost comparison.\n\n\n\n**Phase 2: Temperature Control & Documentation Enhancement (4-6 weeks)**\n\n**Step 3: Implement Robust Temperature Monitoring System**\n\n* **Action:** Implement a system utilizing calibrated data loggers placed *inside* each container.  These loggers should record temperature data at regular intervals (e.g., every hour) and provide real-time alerts via a cloud-based platform if temperatures deviate from acceptable ranges. Explore blockchain integration for immutable temperature data recording.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 (HACCP) \u2013 requires monitoring and control of critical control points, including temperature.\n* **Reasoning:**  Provides verifiable evidence of temperature control throughout the supply chain.  Real-time alerts allow for proactive intervention. Blockchain enhances data integrity and transparency.\n* **Documentation Workflow:**\n    * Select and procure appropriate data loggers.\n    * Develop a standard operating procedure (SOP) for logger placement, data download, and analysis.\n    * Integrate data logger data into the HACCP plan.\n    * Explore blockchain platforms compatible with supply chain data.\n\n**Step 4: Enhance Temperature Control Documentation**\n\n* **Action:**  Develop a standardized temperature log template that includes: container number, product description, temperature readings at key points (departure, arrival at transshipment port, arrival at destination), date and time of readings, name and signature of the person recording the data.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 \u2013 requires detailed records of temperature control measures.\n* **Reasoning:**  Ensures complete and accurate documentation for PVD inspections.\n* **Documentation Workflow:**\n    * Create a standardized temperature log template.\n    * Train staff on proper documentation procedures.\n    * Implement a system for archiving temperature logs.\n\n\n\n**Phase 3: Supplier & Logistics Negotiation & Risk Mitigation (Ongoing)**\n\n**Step 5: Negotiate with Suppliers & OceanEx Logistics**\n\n* **Action:**  Negotiate long-term contracts with Golden Ocean Fisheries, Siam Marine Products, and IndoAqua Farms, including volume discounts and penalty clauses for delays or temperature excursions.  Negotiate with OceanEx Logistics for improved service levels, competitive freight rates, and proactive communication.\n* **Regulatory Reference:**  Contract law principles \u2013 ensuring enforceable agreements.\n* **Reasoning:**  Secures favorable pricing and service levels.  Provides recourse in case of non-performance.\n* **Documentation Workflow:**\n    * Develop a negotiation strategy.\n    * Draft contract templates with clear terms and conditions.\n    * Document all negotiations and agreements.\n\n**Step 6: Develop Supply Chain Resilience Plan**\n\n* **Action:**  Identify potential disruptions (port strikes, geopolitical instability, weather events). Develop contingency plans, including diversifying sourcing locations (exploring suppliers in other Southeast Asian countries), identifying alternative transportation routes (e.g., rail transport through Poland), and increasing cold storage capacity.\n* **Regulatory Reference:**  Business continuity planning best practices.\n* **Reasoning:**  Minimizes the impact of unforeseen events.\n* **Documentation Workflow:**\n    * Conduct a risk assessment.\n    * Develop contingency plans for each identified risk.\n    * Regularly review and update the resilience plan.\n\n**Phase 4: Data Quality & Customs Compliance (Ongoing)**\n\n**Step 7: Improve Data Quality & Implement EDI**\n\n* **Action:** Implement data validation procedures to ensure accuracy and completeness of import documentation. Train staff on customs regulations. Implement Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) with customs authorities to streamline the customs clearance process.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** EU Customs Code (Regulation (EU) No 952/2013) \u2013 requirements for accurate and complete customs declarations.\n* **Reasoning:**  Reduces customs delays and penalties.\n* **Documentation Workflow:**\n    * Develop data validation rules.\n    * Provide training to staff on customs regulations and data entry procedures.\n    * Implement EDI system and integrate it with existing systems.\n\n\n\n**Monitoring & Evaluation:**\n\n* Regularly monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as transit times, transportation costs, spoilage rates, and customs clearance times.\n* Conduct periodic audits of the temperature monitoring system and documentation procedures.\n* Review and update the supply chain resilience plan as needed.\n\n\n\nThis comprehensive solution provides Baltic Breeze Seafood with a roadmap to navigate the challenges of seafood import and ensure long-term success within the complex EU regulatory landscape.  The phased approach allows for incremental implementation and continuous improvement, minimizing disruption and maximizing return on investment.",
