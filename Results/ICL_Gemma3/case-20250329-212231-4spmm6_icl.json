  "title": "Baltic Breezes Frozen Salmon Fiasco: Maintaining Cold Chain Integrity in EU Exports",
  "solution": "## Executive Summary: Baltic Breeze Frozen Salmon Fiasco\n\nBaltic Breeze Seafood faces a critical threat to its contract with Edeka Nord due to consistent temperature integrity failures during container shipping. This solution addresses the immediate issues of rejected pallets and strained customer relations through a multi-phased approach focusing on enhanced monitoring, carrier accountability, process optimization, and proactive risk mitigation. The core strategy centers on establishing real-time visibility of temperature data, strengthening carrier performance guarantees, and streamlining the pre-shipment and transit processes. This solution emphasizes strict adherence to EU food safety regulations (HACCP, EC No 852/2004, EC No 853/2004), robust documentation, and proactive communication to ensure timely and compliant delivery, thereby safeguarding the contract with Edeka Nord and protecting Baltic Breeze Seafood\u2019s reputation.\n\n## Detailed Solution Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization (Days 1-7) \u2013 Focus: Damage Control & Data Gathering**\n\n* **Step 1: Edeka Nord Communication & Damage Assessment (Regulatory Reference: EU Food Safety Regulations - Traceability)**\n    * **Action:** Immediately contact Edeka Nord to express sincere apologies for the recent temperature excursions and rejected pallets. Offer a full investigation and commitment to corrective action.  Offer credit or replacement shipments for rejected goods, depending on the extent of the damage.\n    * **Reasoning:** Maintaining a strong customer relationship is paramount. Transparency and a willingness to address the issue are crucial.\n    * **Action:**  Collect detailed data from Edeka Nord regarding the rejected pallets \u2013 specific temperature readings, visual inspection reports (thawing, texture), and dates/container numbers.\n    * **Reasoning:** This data is vital for pinpointing the root causes of the temperature excursions.\n* **Step 2:  Oceanic Horizon Lines Accountability & Data Request (Regulatory Reference: Contract Law & Carrier Liability)**\n    * **Action:**  Issue a formal notice of concern to Oceanic Horizon Lines, detailing the temperature excursions and resulting losses. Demand complete PTI (Pre-Trip Inspection) reports for all reefer containers used in the last three months, including photos and detailed temperature logs. Request historical performance data for reefer units on the \"Arctic Voyager\" route.\n    * **Reasoning:** Establishing carrier accountability is essential.  PTI reports are critical for verifying container functionality.\n    * **Action:**  Request access to Oceanic Horizon Lines\u2019 temperature monitoring data for the affected containers *during transit* \u2013 not just the final logs.\n    * **Reasoning:**  Identifying *when* and *where* temperature deviations occurred is crucial.\n* **Step 3: Riga Cold Storage Audit (Regulatory Reference: HACCP Principles - Temperature Control)**\n    * **Action:** Conduct an immediate audit of Riga Cold Storage\u2019s temperature control procedures, focusing on dwell times, temperature monitoring, and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) inventory management.\n    * **Reasoning:**  Identifying potential temperature breaches during pre-shipment storage is critical.\n\n\n\n**Phase 2: Short-Term Corrective Actions (Weeks 2-4) \u2013 Focus: Enhanced Monitoring & Process Improvement**\n\n* **Step 1: Implement Real-Time Temperature Monitoring (Regulatory Reference: HACCP Principles - Critical Control Points)**\n    * **Action:** Invest in and deploy a real-time temperature monitoring system. Options include:\n        * **IoT Sensors:** Install temperature sensors inside containers that transmit data via cellular or satellite connectivity.\n        * **Cloud-Based Platform:** Utilize a cloud-based platform to visualize temperature data, set alerts for deviations, and generate reports. (e.g., Sensitech, Emerson Cargo Solutions)\n    * **Reasoning:** Real-time visibility allows for proactive intervention and prevents further temperature excursions.\n* **Step 2: Strengthen Carrier Contract & Performance Guarantees (Regulatory Reference: Contract Law)**\n    * **Action:** Renegotiate the contract with Oceanic Horizon Lines to include:\n        * **Stricter Temperature Tolerance:** Reduce the acceptable temperature deviation to +/- 1\u00b0C.\n        * **Performance-Based Penalties:** Implement financial penalties for temperature excursions exceeding the tolerance.\n        * **PTI Report Guarantee:** Require complete and verified PTI reports for *every* reefer container.\n        * **Data Access:**  Mandatory access to real-time temperature data during transit.\n    * **Reasoning:**  Incentivizes Oceanic Horizon Lines to prioritize temperature control.\n* **Step 3: Optimize Pre-Shipment Process at Riga Cold Storage (Regulatory Reference: HACCP Principles - Temperature Control)**\n    * **Action:** Implement a strict FIFO inventory management system.\n    * **Action:** Invest in insulated container covers to protect containers awaiting loading from ambient temperature fluctuations.\n    * **Action:** Ensure Riga Cold Storage maintains a consistent temperature of -20\u00b0C or lower.\n    * **Reasoning:** Minimizes dwell time and protects product integrity during pre-shipment storage.\n* **Step 4: Packaging Enhancement (Regulatory Reference: Packaging Regulations)**\n    * **Action:** Evaluate and implement improved packaging solutions. Consider:\n        * **Vacuum Insulated Panels (VIPs):** Offer superior insulation compared to traditional materials.\n        * **Phase Change Materials (PCMs):**  Absorb or release heat to maintain a stable temperature.\n    * **Reasoning:** Provides an additional layer of temperature protection during transit.\n\n**Phase 3: Long-Term Resilience (Months 3-6) \u2013 Focus: Route Optimization & Risk Mitigation**\n\n* **Step 1: Route Optimization & Direct Calls (Regulatory Reference: Logistics Optimization)**\n    * **Action:** Negotiate with Oceanic Horizon Lines for a direct service to Hamburg and Gothenburg, bypassing Rotterdam.\n    * **Action:** If a direct service is not feasible, explore alternative carriers offering more direct routes.\n    * **Reasoning:** Reduces transit time, handling, and the risk of temperature excursions.\n* **Step 2: Supplier Diversification (Regulatory Reference: Supply Chain Management)**\n    * **Action:**  Identify and qualify alternative carriers with a proven track record of cold chain integrity.\n    * **Reasoning:** Reduces reliance on a single carrier and provides leverage in negotiations.\n* **Step 3:  Incoterms Review (Regulatory Reference: Incoterms 2020)**\n    * **Action:**  Evaluate shifting Incoterms to DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) or DAP (Delivered at Place) to transfer more responsibility for temperature control to Baltic Breeze Seafood until the goods reach Edeka Nord\u2019s distribution centers.\n    * **Reasoning:**  Greater control over the entire supply chain.\n* **Step 4:  Insurance Coverage (Regulatory Reference: Cargo Insurance)**\n    * **Action:** Secure comprehensive cargo insurance that specifically covers temperature-related damage and rejection, including coverage for consequential losses.\n    * **Reasoning:**  Provides financial protection in the event of temperature excursions.\n\n\n\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring & Continuous Improvement:**\n\n* Regularly review temperature data and identify trends.\n* Conduct periodic audits of all stakeholders (RCS, Oceanic Horizon Lines, TransBaltic Logistics).\n* Continuously evaluate and improve packaging solutions and temperature monitoring technology.\n* Maintain open communication with Edeka Nord and proactively address any concerns.\n\n\n\nThis comprehensive solution, implemented in phases, will enable Baltic Breeze Seafood to regain control of its cold chain, minimize the risk of cargo rejection, and maintain its valuable contract with Edeka Nord.  It prioritizes proactive monitoring, carrier accountability, and continuous improvement to ensure the long-term success of the business.",
