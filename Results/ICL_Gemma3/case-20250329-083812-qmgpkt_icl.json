  "title": "Baltic Breeze Logistics: Navigating Peak Season Storms - A Strategic Shipping Dilemma",
  "solution": "## Executive Summary Baltic Breeze Logistics (BBL) faces a critical shipping dilemma during the peak season, balancing rising costs, potential disruptions, and competitive pressures. This solution proposes a hybrid approach combining strategic negotiation with Orient Express Shipping Lines (OESL), a phased introduction of sourcing from Kexing Manufacturing in China, and proactive measures to mitigate congestion and fuel surcharge impacts. By leveraging backhaul capacity, diversifying sourcing, and enhancing supply chain visibility, BBL can improve its profitability, resilience, and customer service during the peak season and beyond. The solution emphasizes compliance with EU Customs Code, ISPS Code, and accurate HS code classification for imported goods.\n\n## Detailed Solution Steps\n\n**Step 1: Immediate Action \u2013 Deep Dive into OESL Rate Breakdown & Backhaul Opportunity Assessment (Week 1)**\n\n* **Action:** Request a detailed breakdown of the proposed rate increase from OESL, specifically separating the base freight rate from the Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF). Understand the BAF calculation methodology and its sensitivity to fuel price fluctuations.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** N/A \u2013 Commercial negotiation.\n* **Reasoning:** Transparency in pricing allows for targeted negotiation. Understanding the BAF allows BBL to anticipate future cost changes.\n* **Action:** Immediately investigate potential export cargo from Latvia to Asia. Focus on products with existing demand in Asian markets (e.g., timber, agricultural products, processed foods). Contact the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia for support.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Export regulations of Latvia, import regulations of target Asian countries.\n* **Reasoning:** Identifying export cargo unlocks potential for negotiating lower rates with OESL by filling backhaul capacity.\n* **Action:**  Contact other Latvian businesses to explore opportunities for consolidated exports to Asia.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Commercial agreements, export regulations.\n* **Reasoning:** Pooling cargo volume increases negotiating power with OESL.\n* **Implementation:** Dedicated team member assigned to rate analysis and backhaul investigation. Target completion within 3 days.\n\n**Step 2: Negotiating with OESL \u2013 Leveraging Backhaul & Volume (Week 1-2)**\n\n* **Action:** Present OESL with a proposal outlining potential backhaul cargo volume (either BBL\u2019s identified exports or a consolidated shipment with other Latvian businesses).  Negotiate a reduced rate based on this commitment.  Frame the negotiation as a mutually beneficial partnership.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Commercial agreements.\n* **Reasoning:**  OESL benefits from filled containers, reducing repositioning costs. BBL benefits from lower freight rates.\n* **Action:**  If backhaul negotiation is unsuccessful, negotiate a cap on the BAF, or a fixed BAF rate for the peak season, based on current fuel price projections.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Commercial agreements.\n* **Reasoning:** Provides cost predictability during a volatile period.\n* **Action:**  Secure a commitment from OESL regarding priority loading and unloading at both Gothenburg and Riga, even during peak congestion.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** Commercial agreements.\n* **Reasoning:** Minimizes delays and demurrage/detention charges.\n* **Implementation:**  Inga Bergman to lead negotiation with OESL.  Document all agreements in writing.\n\n**Step 3: Phased Sourcing from Kexing Manufacturing \u2013 Risk Mitigation & Cost Analysis (Week 1-2)**\n\n* **Action:** Initiate a pilot program sourcing a *limited* range of non-critical furniture components (e.g., drawer slides, handles) from Kexing Manufacturing.  Limit initial order volume to 1-2 containers.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** EU Customs Code, EU product safety regulations (e.g., REACH, RoHS), labeling requirements.\n* **Reasoning:** Allows BBL to test Kexing\u2019s quality, lead times, and compliance without significant risk.\n* **Action:**  Engage a reputable customs broker specializing in imports from China to ensure accurate HS code classification, duty calculation, and compliance with EU import regulations.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** EU Customs Code, Harmonized System (HS) code.\n* **Reasoning:**  Minimizes the risk of penalties and delays due to incorrect customs declarations.\n* **Action:**  Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis comparing the total landed cost of sourcing from Kexing (including transportation, import duties, customs clearance fees, quality control costs) versus existing Scandinavian suppliers.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** N/A \u2013 Internal cost accounting.\n* **Reasoning:**  Provides a clear understanding of the potential cost savings.\n* **Implementation:**  Dedicated team member assigned to manage the pilot program and cost analysis.\n\n**Step 4:  Mitigating Congestion & Enhancing Visibility (Ongoing \u2013 Peak Season)**\n\n* **Action:**  Implement a Transportation Management System (TMS) to track shipments in real-time and improve communication with OESL, RCT, and GOT. Integrate the TMS with OESL\u2019s tracking system.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** N/A \u2013 Operational improvement.\n* **Reasoning:**  Provides proactive visibility into potential delays and allows for timely adjustments.\n* **Action:**  Explore alternative routes through the Port of Gdansk as a contingency plan if Gothenburg experiences severe congestion.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** EU Customs Code.\n* **Reasoning:**  Provides a backup option to avoid delays.\n* **Action:**  Maintain close communication with RCT and GOT to monitor congestion levels and proactively adjust delivery schedules.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** N/A \u2013 Operational communication.\n* **Reasoning:**  Allows for proactive mitigation of congestion impacts.\n* **Implementation:**  TMS implementation to be completed within 4 weeks.  Regular communication with ports and OESL throughout the peak season.\n\n\n\n**Step 5: Monitoring & Evaluation (Ongoing \u2013 Post Peak Season)**\n\n* **Action:**  Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as freight costs, transit times, demurrage/detention charges, and customer satisfaction throughout the peak season.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** N/A \u2013 Internal performance monitoring.\n* **Reasoning:**  Provides data for evaluating the effectiveness of the chosen strategy.\n* **Action:**  Conduct a post-peak season review to assess the performance of each element of the strategy and identify areas for improvement.\n* **Regulatory Reference:** N/A \u2013 Internal review.\n* **Reasoning:**  Informs future shipping strategies.\n\n\n\n\nThis solution provides a balanced approach, mitigating risk while capitalizing on potential opportunities.  The phased approach to sourcing from China allows BBL to test the waters without overcommitting, while the focus on negotiation and backhaul capacity leverages existing relationships and potentially reduces costs.  Continuous monitoring and evaluation will ensure that BBL remains agile and responsive to changing market conditions.",
