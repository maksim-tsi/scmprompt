  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Reefer Route Risk: Neptune Lines Race Against Time and Temperature in the Baltic Trade**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Neptune Lines, a medium-sized container shipping company headquartered in Hamburg, Germany, is facing a perfect storm of operational and regulatory challenges managing its reefer container flows from Southeast Asia to the Baltic Sea region. Neptune Lines primarily serves niche markets, specializing in the transportation of temperature-sensitive goods, such as seafood, exotic fruits, and pharmaceuticals. Their current strategy relies on a hub-and-spoke model, with transshipment occurring in Rotterdam before feeder vessels distribute containers to ports in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. **Key Entities:** * **Neptune Lines:** A container shipping company based in Hamburg, Germany. Operates a fleet of 15 container vessels, including the *MS Baltic Breeze* and the *MS Singapore Trader*. Neptune Lines is under increasing pressure from its shareholders to improve profitability and operational efficiency. * **Asian Exporters:** Suppliers of seafood, fruits, and pharmaceuticals based in Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. These exporters are demanding more reliable transit times and stricter adherence to temperature requirements to maintain product quality. * **European Importers:** Distributors and retailers in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. These importers are increasingly sensitive to delays and spoilage, threatening Neptune Lines' long-term contracts. * **Rotterdam Port Authority:** The main transshipment hub for Neptune Lines' cargo. Congestion and operational inefficiencies in Rotterdam are a major source of delays. * **DCT Gdansk (Deepwater Container Terminal Gdansk):** A major container terminal in Poland, serving as a key destination port. DCT Gdansk requires strict adherence to its terminal operating procedures and documentation requirements. * **Klaipeda State Seaport Authority:** The main port in Lithuania, another important destination for Neptune Lines. The Klaipeda port experiences seasonal ice conditions that can affect vessel schedules. * **Feeder Vessel Operators:** Independent companies contracted by Neptune Lines to transport containers from Rotterdam to Baltic ports. The reliability of these operators is questionable, with frequent schedule changes and capacity constraints. * **GlobalCool Logistics:** Neptune Lines' main reefer container maintenance and repair provider. GlobalCool Logistics is struggling to meet the increasing demand for reefer container maintenance, leading to container shortages. **Core Regulatory Issues:** * **EU Food Safety Regulations:** Compliance with stringent temperature control requirements for perishable goods throughout the supply chain, as mandated by **Regulation (EC) No 852/2004** and its subsequent amendments. Specifically, Neptune Lines must demonstrate adherence to HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) principles and maintain detailed temperature logs for all reefer containers. Failure to comply can result in significant fines and product recalls. * **Customs and Border Control:** Navigating customs procedures and inspections at multiple ports of entry, including compliance with the **Union Customs Code (UCC)** and the submission of accurate and timely customs declarations. Delays in customs clearance can lead to spoilage and significant financial losses. * **Environmental Regulations:** Adhering to regulations regarding refrigerant usage and emissions from reefer containers, as outlined in **Regulation (EU) No 517/2014** on fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases). Neptune Lines must ensure that its reefer containers use approved refrigerants and maintain records of refrigerant handling and disposal. * **International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code:** Ensuring compliance with the IMDG Code if transporting pharmaceuticals or other goods classified as dangerous goods. This requires proper packaging, labeling, documentation, and stowage of containers. * **ISPS (International Ship and Port Facility Security) Code:** Compliance with security measures required by the ISPS Code at all ports of call and on board vessels, including security assessments, security plans, and security drills. **Problem:** Neptune Lines is facing a critical situation. Customer complaints are rising due to delays, spoilage, and damaged goods. A recent internal audit revealed the following issues: * **Congestion at Rotterdam:** Significant delays during transshipment in Rotterdam, often exceeding 72 hours, leading to temperature fluctuations and reduced shelf life of perishable goods. The *MS Singapore Trader* regularly experiences berthing delays due to port congestion and limited availability of reefer container handling equipment. Data from the Rotterdam Port Authority indicates that reefer containers are experiencing an average dwell time 20% higher than dry containers. **(DATAPOINT 10)** * **Reefer Container Shortage:** Insufficient availability of reefer containers, particularly during peak seasons (e.g., Lunar New Year and European summer). GlobalCool Logistics is struggling to keep up with maintenance and repair demands, with an average turnaround time for reefer container repairs exceeding 10 days. * **Feeder Vessel Reliability:** Inconsistent feeder vessel schedules and capacity limitations affecting timely delivery to Baltic ports. Weather conditions in the Baltic Sea further exacerbate delays. The *MS Baltic Breeze* experienced a significant engine failure last winter, causing widespread disruption and highlighting the need for improved vessel maintenance and contingency planning. * **Communication Breakdown:** Lack of real-time visibility and communication between Neptune Lines, port authorities, feeder vessel operators, and customers, hindering proactive problem-solving. Customers are often left in the dark about the status of their shipments, leading to frustration and distrust. * **Rising Operational Costs:** Increased fuel consumption due to delays, higher container leasing rates, and mounting compensation claims from dissatisfied customers are significantly impacting Neptune Lines' profitability. The company is facing potential legal action from several major importers due to spoilage and delays. * **Bill of Lading Discrepancies:** Frequent errors in the Bill of Lading, such as incorrect weight declarations, misdeclared cargo descriptions, and inaccurate temperature settings, are causing delays in customs clearance and increasing the risk of fines. The CEO of Neptune Lines has tasked the newly formed Logistics Optimization Team to investigate the root causes of these problems and develop a comprehensive strategy to improve the efficiency, reliability, and profitability of its reefer container operations between Southeast Asia and the Baltic Sea. The team must consider all aspects of the supply chain, from origin to destination, and propose solutions that address the identified bottlenecks and challenges while adhering to regulatory requirements, minimizing environmental impact, and improving data quality. They have been given three months to present their findings and recommendations, including a detailed action plan with specific timelines and key performance indicators (KPIs). The team must also address the risk of transporting hazardous goods, considering shippers responsibilities in areas like Yangshan. **(DATAPOINT 12, DATAPOINT 13)**\n",
