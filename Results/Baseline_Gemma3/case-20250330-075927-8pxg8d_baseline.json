  "solution": "## Icy Straits - Klaipeda Krill: Contingency Plan for GSI\n\n**Executive Summary:** This plan outlines a multi-faceted approach for Global Seafood Importers (GSI) to mitigate the supply chain disruption affecting the \"Klaipeda Krill\" shipment. It prioritizes minimizing delays, maintaining product quality, managing costs, and proactively communicating with stakeholders. The plan focuses on immediate actions, short-term mitigation, and long-term resilience building.\n\n**I. Immediate Actions (Within 24-48 Hours):**\n\n* **Documentation Verification & Pre-Clearance:** Ingrid Schmidt to immediately confirm all documentation (Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Health Certificate, IMO delay report) is complete, accurate, and pre-submitted electronically to Rotterdam and Klaipeda customs authorities.  Focus on EU Customs Code (UCC) compliance.  Initiate pre-arrival processing where possible.\n* **Real-Time Tracking & Communication:** Establish 24/7 tracking of the \"Evergreen Baltic\" and \"Baltic Breeze\" using AIS data and direct communication with Evergreen Maritime.  Daily updates from Park Ji-hoon at Ocean Harvest regarding the krill's condition and temperature logs.\n* **Insurance Notification:** Lars Petersen at Oceanic Insurance Group must be formally notified of the delay and potential for further disruptions. Begin compiling documentation for a potential claim, focusing on the initial 48-hour delay due to the storm.\n* **Rotterdam Port Assessment:** Contact Rotterdam Port Authority to understand the extent of congestion and potential berthing delays for the \"Evergreen Baltic.\"  Explore options for expedited offloading, even if incurring additional costs.\n* **Reefer Capacity Confirmation:**  Re-confirm priority booking with \"Baltic Breeze\" and aggressively pursue additional reefer slots.  Investigate alternative feeder vessels with reefer capacity departing Rotterdam for Klaipeda.\n\n\n\n**II. Short-Term Mitigation (Next 7 Days):**\n\nThis phase focuses on minimizing the impact of delays and securing alternative solutions.  A decision matrix will be used to evaluate options (see Section V).\n\n* **Option 1: Prioritization & Negotiation (Primary Focus)**\n    * **Evergreen Maritime:** Negotiate with Evergreen Maritime for priority handling of the \"Klaipeda Krill\" containers in Rotterdam.  Explore potential for faster offloading even if it means incurring demurrage charges (cost-benefit analysis required).\n    * **Baltic Sea Terminals (BST):**  Contact Darius Jankauskas at BST to pre-arrange expedited handling and storage upon arrival.  Discuss potential for priority unloading and access to reefer plugs.\n    * **Baltic Breeze:**  Continue aggressive negotiation for additional reefer capacity.

  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Icy StraitsKlaipeda Krill and the Baltic Supply Chain Freeze\n\nCASE Description:\n**Case Study: Icy Straits - \"Klaipeda Krill\" and the Baltic Supply Chain Freeze** **Scenario:** Global Seafood Importers (GSI), a major European distributor of frozen seafood, is facing a critical supply chain disruption. Their primary supplier of krill, \"Ocean Harvest,\" based in Busan, South Korea, has notified them of significant delays affecting their flagship \"Klaipeda Krill\" product destined for the Baltic market. This disruption coincides with peak seasonal demand, intensifying the pressure on GSI. **Entities:** * **Global Seafood Importers (GSI):** Headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. Key Contact: Ingrid Schmidt, Head of Logistics. *Responsible for ensuring compliance with EU import regulations for food products, including veterinary checks and food safety standards.* * **Ocean Harvest:** A large-scale krill harvesting and processing company based in Busan, South Korea. Key Contact: Park Ji-hoon, Sales Director. *Must provide accurate documentation for export and comply with South Korean regulations regarding seafood exports and traceability.* * **\"Evergreen Baltic\" (Container Vessel):** Operated by Evergreen Maritime, transporting the krill from Busan to Rotterdam. Captain: Captain Sven Larson. *Responsible for adhering to international maritime regulations (SOLAS, MARPOL) and security protocols (ISPS Code).* * **Baltic Sea Terminals (BST):** Container terminal in Klaipeda, Lithuania. Key Contact: Darius Jankauskas, Operations Manager. *Subject to Lithuanian port regulations, including security requirements (ISPS Code implementation) and customs procedures. Must also comply with EU environmental regulations regarding port operations.* * **Nordic Cold Storage (NCS):** GSI\u2019s primary cold storage facility in Klaipeda, Lithuania. Key Contact: Erika Nielsen, Warehouse Manager. *Must maintain temperature control within EU regulations for frozen food storage and comply with health and safety standards for food handling.* * **Oceanic Insurance Group:** GSI\u2019s insurance provider for cargo transit. Key Contact: Lars Petersen, Claims Adjuster. *Evaluates claims based on international maritime law and insurance policy terms, considering factors such as \"General Average\" and force majeure.* **Operational Challenges:** The \"Evergreen Baltic\" encountered severe weather conditions \u2013 a major winter storm in the Yellow Sea \u2013 delaying its departure from Busan by 48 hours. This delay has a cascading effect on the entire supply chain. The scheduled arrival in Rotterdam is now pushed back, impacting the onward feeder vessel connection to Klaipeda. The *International Maritime Organization (IMO)* requires vessels to report weather-related delays, adding another layer of documentation and potential scrutiny. Further complicating matters: * **Port Congestion in Rotterdam:** Rotterdam is experiencing significant port congestion due to a backlog caused by recent industrial action. This may result in further delays in offloading the \"Klaipeda Krill\" containers. *Rotterdam's Port Authority operates under Dutch and EU regulations, including strict guidelines on container handling and environmental protection.* * **Limited Reefer Capacity:** The feeder vessel connecting Rotterdam to Klaipeda, the \"Baltic Breeze,\" has limited reefer container slots. GSI has a priority booking, but there is a risk of some containers being bumped to a later sailing. *EU Regulation No 37/2005 dictates specific temperature requirements for the transport of quick-frozen foodstuffs, making reefer capacity crucial.* * **Seasonal Demand Surge:** The demand for krill is peaking in the Baltic region in anticipation of the upcoming holiday season. Any significant delay could result in lost sales and damaged relationships with key retail clients. * **Klaipeda Port Operations:** Klaipeda port is known for its susceptibility to ice conditions during winter. While currently ice-free, forecasts indicate a potential freeze-up within the next two weeks, which could further disrupt operations. *The Lithuanian Maritime Safety Administration (under EU directives) will implement icebreaker assistance protocols if ice conditions worsen, potentially causing further delays.* * **Contractual Obligations:** GSI has strict contractual obligations with Ocean Harvest regarding delivery timelines and product quality (maintaining frozen temperatures). Failure to meet these obligations could result in penalties. *These contracts are governed by international commercial law (e.g., CISG) and must adhere to EU consumer protection regulations.* * **EU Import Regulations and Inspections:** *GSI must ensure compliance with EU regulations regarding the import of food products, including veterinary checks at the EU border and compliance with food safety standards (e.g., HACCP). A delay increases the risk of spoilage and potential rejection by customs officials.* **The Problem:** Ingrid Schmidt at GSI needs to develop a contingency plan to mitigate the impact of the initial delay and potential subsequent disruptions. She must consider the costs and benefits of various options, including: * Exploring alternative shipping routes (e.g., rail transport from Rotterdam or other Baltic ports). *Rail transport would require compliance with the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF).* * Negotiating with Evergreen Maritime and Baltic Sea Terminals to prioritize the \u201cKlaipeda Krill\u201d containers. *This negotiation needs to consider potential demurrage charges and port fees.* * Securing additional reefer capacity on the \"Baltic Breeze\" or alternative feeder vessels. *Exploring options such as \"spot rates\" for reefer containers and potential penalties for late delivery.* * Communicating proactively with Nordic Cold Storage and retail clients to manage expectations. *Providing accurate ETAs and potential impact on product availability.* * Assessing the risk of temperature excursions during transit and preparing for potential insurance claims. *Maintaining detailed temperature logs and documenting any deviations from acceptable ranges.* * **Customs Documentation Review:** *Ensuring all required import documentation is complete and accurate, including the Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice, Packing List, and Health Certificate, to avoid delays during customs clearance.* *Compliance with EU Customs Code (UCC) is paramount.* * **Compliance with Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures:** *Ensuring that the krill shipment meets all EU SPS requirements to prevent the introduction of diseases or pests. This may involve additional inspections and certifications.* GSI must determine the most cost-effective and reliable solution to ensure the timely delivery of the \"Klaipeda Krill\" to meet the crucial seasonal demand while minimizing financial losses and reputational damage. The clock is ticking, and the Baltic winter is coming. GSI must also consider the potential impact of *Brexit* on customs procedures, even though the shipment originates outside the UK, as it might influence transit routes or port congestion.\n",
