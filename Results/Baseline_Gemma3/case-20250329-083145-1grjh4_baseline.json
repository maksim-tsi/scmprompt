  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Baltic Breezes Frozen Dilemma: Navigating Supply Chain Disruptions and Sustainability in the Baltic Sea\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods, a leading distributor of premium seafood across Northern Europe, is facing increasing pressure on its supply chain originating from Southeast Asia. They import a variety of frozen seafood, primarily tuna and shrimp, from suppliers in Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. These suppliers must adhere to stringent EU food safety regulations, including Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety, and Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, which requires adherence to HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) principles throughout the supply chain. Currently, all shipments are consolidated by OceanEx Logistics in Singapore and routed through the Suez Canal to Rotterdam, where they are then transshipped to smaller ports within the Baltic Sea region. The \"Asian Star,\" a feeder vessel operated by Starline Feeder Services, connects smaller Southeast Asian ports to Singapore, while the long-haul transport is handled by container vessels. **Entities:** * Baltic Breeze Seafoods (Importer/Distributor): Responsible for ensuring compliance with EU food safety regulations and customs requirements. * Southeast Asian Seafood Suppliers (Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia): Must meet EU food safety standards and provide necessary documentation. * OceanEx Logistics (Consolidator in Singapore): Responsible for consolidating shipments, ensuring proper temperature control, and preparing necessary documentation for export, including compliance with Singaporean customs regulations. * Port of Rotterdam: Major European port experiencing congestion. * Port of Gdansk (potential): Alternative port for direct shipments. * \"Baltic Mariner\" - a fictional ice-classed container vessel owned by Nordsee Shipping, suitable for navigating Baltic Sea winter conditions. * \"Asian Star\" - a fictional feeder vessel connecting smaller Southeast Asian ports to Singapore, operated by Starline Feeder Services. **Regulatory Issues:** * **EU Food Safety Regulations:** Baltic Breeze must ensure that all seafood imports comply with EU regulations, including Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. This includes maintaining strict temperature control throughout the supply chain (as per Commission Regulation (EC) No 37/2005 on the monitoring of temperatures in the means of transport, warehousing and storage of quick-frozen foodstuffs intended for human consumption) and implementing robust traceability systems. Documentation must include catch certificates (to comply with IUU fishing regulations - Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing), health certificates, and detailed temperature logs. The company must also be prepared for inspections by EU food safety authorities. * **EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):** The upcoming CBAM will impose a carbon levy on imports of certain goods (currently not seafood, but likely to expand), based on the carbon emissions associated with their production and transportation. Baltic Breeze needs to assess the carbon footprint of its current supply chain and the potential impact of CBAM on its costs. This includes evaluating the emissions from shipping, including both the \"Asian Star\" feeder vessel and the main container vessels. * **Customs Regulations:** Baltic Breeze must comply with EU customs regulations, including providing accurate declarations, paying applicable duties and taxes, and adhering to import restrictions. This includes proper documentation such as the Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice, Packing List, and Customs Declaration. * **Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS):** These measures aim to protect human, animal, and plant health. Baltic Breeze must ensure compliance with SPS requirements to prevent the introduction of diseases or pests into the EU. **Problem:** Baltic Breeze is experiencing significant delays and increased costs due to congestion at Rotterdam and the subsequent transshipment process. These delays are impacting the freshness and quality of their seafood, leading to customer complaints, potential contract breaches (especially concerning delivery deadlines and quality specifications), and potential financial penalties. They are exploring the feasibility of establishing a direct shipping route from Singapore to the Port of Gdansk, Poland, to bypass Rotterdam. This option would require using ice-classed vessels like the \"Baltic Mariner\" capable of navigating potential winter conditions in the Baltic Sea. They must consider: * **Increased Direct Transit Time:** A direct route will likely take longer than the current route, impacting the shelf life of the frozen seafood. * **Impact of Ice Conditions:** Ice conditions in the Baltic Sea can significantly reduce vessel speed and increase fuel consumption. * **Availability of Ice-Classed Vessels:** The availability and charter rates of suitable ice-classed vessels need to be assessed. * **Infrastructure at Gdansk:** The Port of Gdansk's capacity to handle increased volumes of refrigerated containers (reefers) and the availability of cold storage facilities needs to be confirmed. * **Environmental Impact:** A comparative assessment of the environmental impact of the two routing options is required, including fuel consumption, emissions, and potential impacts on marine ecosystems. This is crucial considering the upcoming CBAM regulations. * **Cost-Effectiveness:** A detailed cost analysis is needed to compare the direct route (including increased fuel consumption, higher vessel charter rates, and potential ice navigation costs) with the current Rotterdam-based system (including transshipment costs, port congestion charges, and potential penalties for delays). This analysis must also factor in the potential impact of CBAM on both routes. * **Documentation:** The change in route and port of entry will necessitate changes to the required documentation and procedures, including customs declarations and health certificates. **Decision:** Baltic Breeze needs to conduct a thorough feasibility study, considering all the above factors, to determine whether a direct shipping route to Gdansk is a viable and sustainable alternative to their current supply chain. They need to develop a risk management plan to mitigate potential disruptions caused by weather conditions, port congestion, or regulatory changes. They also need to evaluate the potential for long-term partnerships with shipping lines and port authorities to ensure a reliable and efficient supply chain.\n",
