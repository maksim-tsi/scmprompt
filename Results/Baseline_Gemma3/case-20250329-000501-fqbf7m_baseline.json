  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Salmon Run Disrupted: Navigating Baltic Port Congestion and Reefer Container Shortages**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Case Description:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods (BBS), a rapidly growing exporter of premium Norwegian salmon and cod, is facing a critical challenge in its container shipping operations. Based in Bergen, Norway, BBS relies heavily on efficient transport to satisfy burgeoning demand in Asian markets, particularly China and South Korea. Their established route involves trucking refrigerated containers from Bergen to Gothenburg, Sweden, where they are loaded onto the \"Northern Lights\" service, a weekly container vessel operated by the fictional Baltic Shipping Consortium (BSC). The \"Northern Lights\" makes port calls at Hamburg, Rotterdam, and then sails through the Baltic Sea, calling at Gdansk, Poland, before transiting the Suez Canal en route to Singapore and ultimately Busan and Shanghai. Over the past six months, BBS has experienced a significant increase in delays and disruptions, primarily originating in the Baltic leg of the journey. Specifically, the \"Northern Lights\" service has consistently faced increasing dwell times in Gdansk, often exceeding 48 hours, due to a combination of factors: * **Port Congestion at Gdansk:** The Port of Gdansk, despite ongoing expansion efforts, struggles to keep pace with growing container volumes, leading to berthing delays and slow container handling. Increased cargo to and from Ukraine via rail is further exacerbating the issue. This congestion directly impacts the timely submission and processing of key import documents, as outlined in the **Import Documentation Workflow** (Pre-Arrival, Arrival/Clearance, Post-Clearance phases). * **Equipment Shortages:** BSC, despite its efforts, is experiencing shortages of refrigerated (reefer) containers in Gdansk, leading to delays in loading BBS's perishable cargo. This is partly attributed to imbalanced container flows, with more containers arriving in Gdansk than departing to Asia. The shortage necessitates careful management of **Bill of Lading (B/L) data** to track container locations and prevent discrepancies. * **Increased Security Inspections:** Heightened security measures and customs inspections in Gdansk, due to geopolitical tensions in the region, are contributing to longer processing times for refrigerated containers. This includes scrutiny of the **Entry Summary Declaration (ENS)** and **Summary Arrival Declaration (SAL)**, both requiring accurate pre-arrival information. Furthermore, BBS must ensure strict adherence to ISPS (International Ship and Port Facility Security) code requirements. * **Winter Weather:** During the winter months (November-March), severe weather conditions in the Baltic Sea, including ice formation and storms, can cause further delays and navigational hazards, impacting the \u201cNorthern Lights\u201d schedule. This necessitates contingency planning and potentially the use of ice-class vessels, adding to transportation costs. These delays have a direct impact on BBS. The company's salmon and cod are highly perishable, and any significant delay can compromise the product's quality and shelf life, resulting in rejected shipments and financial losses. Furthermore, the increased transit times are eroding BBS's competitive edge in the Asian market, as rival exporters from Chile and Canada can offer faster and more reliable delivery schedules. BBS's CEO, Astrid Olsen, is under pressure from her sales team and key customers to find a solution. She has tasked her logistics manager, Erik Svensson, with identifying alternative shipping routes, optimizing container management, and mitigating the risks associated with port congestion and security inspections. Erik must consider the cost implications of each potential solution, balancing the need for speed and reliability with maintaining profitability. He is considering options such as: * **Alternative Ports:** Using alternative ports in the Baltic region (e.g., Klaipeda, Riga), evaluating their infrastructure, handling capacity, and customs clearance efficiency. This requires a thorough analysis of port tariffs, terminal handling charges, and potential inland transportation costs. * **Different Shipping Lines:** Exploring different shipping lines with potentially less congested routes, focusing on carriers with a strong track record of on-time performance and reliable reefer container availability. Evaluating **Master Bill of Lading (MBL)** terms and conditions is crucial. * **Negotiating Priority Handling:** Negotiating priority handling with BSC, potentially through premium service agreements or strategic partnerships. This would require demonstrating the value of BBS's cargo to BSC and agreeing on specific performance metrics. * **Advanced Temperature Monitoring:** Investing in advanced temperature monitoring technology (e.g., IoT-enabled sensors) to minimize spoilage risks during delays. This technology would provide real-time temperature data, allowing for proactive intervention and preventing shipment rejections. * **Optimizing Documentation Processes:** Implementing Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for faster and more accurate document exchange with BSC and customs authorities. This includes ensuring compliance with the 24-hour manifest rule and minimizing potential **Bill of Lading (B/L) errors** related to weight, container numbers, and cargo descriptions. * **Exploring Blockchain Solutions:** Investigating blockchain-based cargo release systems to improve transparency and efficiency in the documentation process. This could streamline customs clearance and reduce the risk of fraud. * **Hazardous Goods Compliance:** Ensuring that if any additives or refrigerants used in the reefer containers are classified as hazardous goods, all necessary documentation and labeling requirements are strictly followed, complying with regulations such as the IMDG Code. * **Environmental Impact Assessment:** Conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment of any proposed changes to the supply chain, considering factors such as carbon emissions, fuel consumption, and potential impacts on marine ecosystems. Erik must also consider the environmental impact of any changes to their supply chain. He needs to present Astrid with a comprehensive analysis of each option, including a cost-benefit analysis, a risk assessment, and a sustainability assessment. The core problem facing BBS is how to maintain its competitive advantage in the Asian seafood market by overcoming the bottlenecks and disruptions in its Baltic Sea container shipping operations, while controlling costs, minimizing environmental impact, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.\n",
