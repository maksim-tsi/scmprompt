  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Baltic Bottleneck Blues: Seafood Spoilage, Supply Chain Snags, and Solutions for Baltic Breeze Seafoods**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Case Title: Baltic Bottleneck Blues: Seafood Spoilage, Supply Chain Snags, and Solutions for Baltic Breeze Seafoods** **Scenario:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods (BBS), a rapidly growing importer of premium frozen seafood based in Riga, Latvia, faces a critical logistics challenge threatening its profitability and market share. BBS sources a significant portion of its product \u2013 primarily high-value Alaskan Pollock and Chilean Sea Bass \u2013 from suppliers in Busan, South Korea, and Valparaiso, Chile. These shipments are transported via container vessels to Northern European ports, primarily Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Hamburg, Germany, before being transshipped to Riga. BBS contracts with Global Shipping Alliance (GSA), a major container shipping company operating the \"Asia-Baltic Express\" service. This service utilizes several post-Panamax container vessels, including the fictional MV \"Baltic Star\" and MV \"Northern Lights,\" each with a capacity of approximately 14,000 TEU. While GSA offers competitive freight rates, BBS has experienced increasing delays and unpredictable arrival times over the past year. **Problem:** The root causes of these disruptions are multifaceted: * **Port Congestion:** Rotterdam and Hamburg, key transshipment hubs, are frequently experiencing significant congestion due to increased cargo volumes, labor shortages, and infrastructure limitations. This congestion leads to delays in unloading BBS\u2019s containers, adding days or even weeks to the overall transit time. During peak seasons (e.g., Chinese New Year, Christmas), the situation worsens considerably. This congestion also impacts the timely processing of import documentation, including the *Ship's Manifest* which is crucial for customs & tax supervision (per Domain Guidelines). * **Feeder Vessel Delays:** The onward transport from Rotterdam or Hamburg to Riga relies on feeder vessels operated by smaller companies like Riga Feeder Lines. These feeder services are susceptible to weather-related delays in the Baltic Sea, particularly during winter months. Unexpected maintenance issues with feeder vessels also contribute to the problem. * **Empty Container Repositioning:** GSA is struggling with the efficient repositioning of empty containers back to Asia. This can lead to shortages of available containers in Busan and Valparaiso when BBS's suppliers need them, further disrupting the supply chain and potentially causing increased *container storage costs*. * **Rising Costs:** The delays and inefficiencies translate directly into increased costs for BBS. They incur demurrage charges at ports, higher inventory holding costs due to longer transit times, and potential penalties for late deliveries to their customers (major supermarket chains across the Baltic region). Furthermore, the increased fuel surcharges and congestion fees imposed by GSA are eating into BBS's profit margins. * **Customs Clearance Delays:** (Addressing Domain Guidelines on Customs) Inaccurate or incomplete documentation, particularly the *Bill of Lading (B/L)*, is causing delays in customs clearance in Rotterdam and Hamburg. The *Entry Summary Declaration (ENS)*, a pre-loading notification, is not always being submitted accurately or on time, leading to further scrutiny by customs authorities. This is compounded by BBS's lack of integration with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems used by customs authorities, hindering data accuracy and timeliness. * **Reefer Container Management:** (Adding a specific challenge related to refrigerated cargo) The availability of reefer plugs for refrigerated containers is inconsistent at both Rotterdam and Hamburg, leading to potential temperature excursions and spoilage of the frozen seafood. This is further complicated by the need for proper documentation of temperature logs, as required by EU regulations on food safety. **Specific Incidents:** * A recent shipment of Chilean Sea Bass aboard the MV \"Baltic Star\" was delayed by 10 days in Rotterdam due to port congestion *and a discrepancy between the declared weight on the B/L and the actual weight*. This resulted in BBS missing a crucial promotional window with a major supermarket chain, leading to significant financial losses. The *House Bill of Lading (HBL)* used by the freight forwarder contained an error that was not caught until the container arrived, exacerbating the delay. * A container of Alaskan Pollock was held up in Hamburg for a week due to a shortage of reefer plugs (power outlets for refrigerated containers). *The temperature logs were also incomplete, raising concerns about potential spoilage and requiring additional inspections by food safety authorities*. The delay risked compromising the quality of the frozen seafood. * BBS has received complaints from its suppliers in Busan regarding the availability of containers. This has forced BBS to pay premium rates to secure containers from alternative sources. *Furthermore, GSA is not providing timely updates on container availability, hindering BBS's ability to plan effectively*. * A shipment was recently flagged for increased customs inspection due to incomplete ISPS compliance documentation (International Ship and Port Facility Security Code), as mandated by EU security regulations. **The Challenge:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods needs to develop a robust logistics strategy to mitigate the impact of these disruptions and ensure reliable delivery of its products to market. The company must consider alternative routing options (e.g., exploring direct shipments to smaller Baltic ports), negotiate better terms with its shipping partners (including service level agreements with penalties for delays), explore alternative transportation modes (e.g., rail freight from Rotterdam to Riga), and potentially invest in its own warehousing and distribution capabilities in the Baltic region. They should also review their documentation processes to ensure accuracy and compliance with customs regulations, including the timely submission of ENS and accurate B/L information. Exploring blockchain-based cargo release systems could also streamline customs procedures. The CEO of Baltic Breeze Seafoods, Ms. Ilze Kalnina, has tasked her logistics team with finding a solution that balances cost efficiency, reliability, and customer service. She has given them a strict deadline to present their recommendations, as the company's competitive advantage is at stake. They must also present a plan to address the reefer container management issues and implement a system for monitoring and documenting temperature logs throughout the supply chain. A review of the *Incoterms* used in their contracts is also necessary to ensure clarity on responsibilities and risks. This enhanced case incorporates specific details related to regulatory compliance, documentation requirements, and other relevant factors based on the provided datapoints and domain guidelines. It also adds more realistic elements, such as the error on the B/L and the incomplete temperature logs, making the scenario more educational and challenging.\n",
