  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Baltic Bottleneck: Navigating Traceability Regulations and Congestion in Seafood Exports to Asia**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** NordSea Foods, a rapidly growing Norwegian seafood exporter, is experiencing significant delays and increased costs in its container shipments to key Asian markets, particularly China and Japan. Despite a surge in demand for its premium salmon and cod products, NordSea is struggling to maintain its competitive edge due to logistical inefficiencies originating in the Baltic Sea region. This is exacerbated by increasing regulatory scrutiny in both the EU and China. **Key Entities:** * **NordSea Foods:** Norwegian seafood exporter headquartered in Bergen. * **OceanWave Shipping:** A mid-sized container shipping company operating between Northern Europe and Asia. * **Baltic Hub Terminals (BHT):** A major container terminal operator with facilities in Gdansk, Poland and Klaipeda, Lithuania. * **Far East Seafood Importers Association (FESIA):** Representative body for seafood importers in China and Japan. * **MV Arctic Voyager:** A fictional, but typical, 4,500 TEU container vessel owned by OceanWave Shipping, regularly sailing the Northern Europe-Asia route. * **Shanghai Customs Authority:** Responsible for enforcing import regulations and customs clearance procedures in Shanghai, China. **Operational Details:** NordSea Foods utilizes reefer containers to transport its temperature-sensitive cargo. These containers are shipped from various smaller Norwegian ports (e.g., \u00c5lesund, Troms\u00f8) to larger consolidation hubs in the Baltic Sea region, primarily Gdansk and Klaipeda. At these hubs, containers are transferred to larger OceanWave Shipping vessels like the MV Arctic Voyager for onward transport to Asian ports, including Shanghai, Ningbo, and Yokohama. OceanWave Shipping has been experiencing increasing congestion at the Baltic Hub Terminals, particularly in Gdansk. This congestion is attributed to a combination of factors: a surge in overall container traffic, limited terminal capacity, labor shortages, and increasing scrutiny of cargo documentation related to new EU regulations on seafood traceability. This includes stricter requirements for providing detailed information on the origin, processing, and handling of seafood products, necessitating more thorough documentation and potentially leading to delays in customs clearance. *Key documentation includes a comprehensive Bill of Lading, Ship's Manifest, and adherence to Incoterms which clearly define responsibilities.* Specifically, the *Entry Summary Declaration (ENS)*, required *before loading*, is often found to have errors leading to delays. *The Summary Arrival Declaration (SAL)*, which must be submitted *before arrival* in ports like Shanghai, is another pain point. Furthermore, NordSea has received complaints from FESIA members regarding the condition of the seafood upon arrival in Asia. While the refrigeration units on the containers are functioning correctly, the extended transit times due to the Baltic bottlenecks have resulted in a reduction in shelf life and, in some instances, spoilage of the most delicate seafood products. This is damaging NordSea's reputation for quality and potentially leading to lost contracts. Adding to the complexity, Chinese customs authorities, particularly in Shanghai (Yangshan Port Customs), are increasingly stringent on verifying the accuracy and completeness of customs declarations for container shipments (*referencing Datapoint 14 and 13*). This includes meticulous checks on the declared value, product classification (HS codes), and compliance with Chinese food safety standards. Discrepancies can lead to lengthy inspections, fines, and even rejection of the shipment. The *International Maritime Transportation Business* regulations in China also play a role, requiring NordSea and OceanWave to adhere to specific licensing and operational requirements to legally transport goods to Chinese ports (*referencing Datapoint 10*). Failure to comply can result in delays and penalties. **Problem:** NordSea Foods needs to urgently address the logistical bottlenecks in the Baltic Sea region that are causing delays, increasing costs, and impacting the quality of its seafood exports to Asia. The company must develop a strategy that mitigates the impact of port congestion, optimizes its container routing, and ensures the timely and temperature-controlled delivery of its products to maintain its competitive advantage in the Asian market. They need to consider alternative routing options, negotiate better terms with OceanWave Shipping and Baltic Hub Terminals, and potentially invest in new technologies or infrastructure to improve efficiency and reduce transit times. Specifically, NordSea needs to: 1. **Improve Documentation Accuracy:** Ensure all documentation, including the Bill of Lading, commercial invoices, and customs declarations, are accurate and complete to avoid delays with customs authorities in both the EU and China. *Implement best practices to mitigate Bill of Lading errors.* 2. **Optimize Reefer Container Management:** Implement real-time monitoring of reefer container temperature and location to identify and address any temperature excursions or delays promptly. 3. **Explore Alternative Routing:** Investigate alternative shipping routes that bypass the congested Baltic Sea region, potentially utilizing ports in Western Europe or directly shipping from Norway to Asia. 4. **Negotiate Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Negotiate SLAs with OceanWave Shipping and Baltic Hub Terminals that guarantee specific transit times and prioritize the handling of reefer containers carrying perishable goods. 5. **Investigate Blockchain Solutions:** Evaluate the potential of blockchain technology to improve supply chain visibility, transparency, and traceability, potentially streamlining customs clearance and reducing the risk of fraud (*referencing Datapoint 11*). 6. **Ensure Regulatory Compliance:** Stay up-to-date on the latest EU and Chinese regulations related to seafood traceability, food safety, and customs procedures, and implement robust compliance programs to avoid penalties and delays. *This includes strict adherence to documentation requirements under international trade and shipping regulations, as well as compliance with customs authorities in Shanghai.* 7. **Evaluate the use of EDI (Electronic Data Interchange):** Implement EDI to improve data accuracy and timeliness. This can expedite customs clearance.\n",
