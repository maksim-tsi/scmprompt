  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Arctic Bottleneck: Navigating Northern Sea Route Disruptions and Gdynia Port Congestion**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** GlobalTech Solutions, a rapidly expanding manufacturer of high-end server components headquartered in Shenzhen, China, is experiencing significant disruptions in its supply chain for its European and Baltic markets. GlobalTech relies heavily on container shipping via the Northern Sea Route to reach key distribution hubs in Rotterdam, Hamburg, and increasingly, Gdynia, Poland, to serve its growing customer base in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states. GlobalTech contracts with OceanWave Shipping, a major container line operating the \"Baltic Express\" service, using vessels like the *OceanWave Triumph* and *OceanWave Venture*. They have a long-term contract based on a fixed TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) rate. However, recent geopolitical instability in the Arctic region and increasing ice melt have led to unpredictable transit times along the Northern Sea Route. This is causing significant delays and increasing operational costs, including icebreaker fees mandated by the *Russian Northern Sea Route Administration (NSRA)* under *Regulation 570 of the Merchant Shipping Code of the Russian Federation* for vessels transiting certain sections during specific periods. Rerouting through the Suez Canal as a contingency adds significant costs and transit time, impacting GlobalTech's overall supply chain efficiency. Furthermore, congestion at the port of Gdynia is exacerbating the problem. While OceanWave Shipping has invested in improved berth facilities, landside infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the rising container volumes. Trucking companies, like BalticTrans Logistics, are experiencing long wait times to pick up and deliver containers, leading to demurrage charges and missed delivery deadlines. This congestion also impacts the availability of chassis and specialized container handling equipment. The port operates under the *International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code*, requiring strict security protocols that, while necessary, can contribute to delays during peak periods. The congestion is further complicated by *EU Customs Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 (Union Customs Code \u2013 UCC)*, which requires all goods entering the EU to undergo customs clearance. The increased volume of containers arriving at Gdynia strains the customs processing capacity, leading to longer inspection times and potential penalties for incomplete or inaccurate documentation. Specific required documents include: * **Commercial Invoice:** Mandatory for all shipments, detailing the value of goods. * **Packing List:** Required for customs inspection and inventory control. * **Bill of Lading:** Essential document of title for the goods. Errors in B/L data are subject to fines under *Poland's Maritime Code*. * **Customs Declaration (SAD):** Required for declaring goods to Polish customs authorities. * **EUR.1 Certificate:** Potentially required for preferential tariff treatment if goods originate in countries with trade agreements with the EU. * **ISF (Importer Security Filing):** Required 24 hours prior to loading at origin. GlobalTech's key customers, including major data centers in Frankfurt and Stockholm, are demanding faster and more reliable delivery times. Penalties for late deliveries are substantial, impacting GlobalTech's profitability and threatening its competitive edge. The current situation is forcing GlobalTech to consider alternative strategies, including: * Negotiating new contracts with OceanWave Shipping to account for unpredictable transit times, potential surcharges for icebreaker services (potentially including a \"Northern Sea Route Risk Premium\"), and penalties for delays caused by port congestion. This negotiation must consider *Incoterms 2020* to clearly define responsibilities for costs and risks. * Exploring alternative port options in the region, such as Klaipeda (Lithuania) or St. Petersburg (Russia), despite potential geopolitical and logistical drawbacks. Klaipeda, for example, offers potentially faster customs processing, but may require adherence to different *Lithuanian customs regulations*. * Investing in its own dedicated trucking fleet within the Baltic region to improve control over last-mile delivery. This investment requires compliance with *EU trucking regulations* regarding driver hours and vehicle emissions. * Establishing a regional distribution center in Poland or Germany to buffer against delays and improve responsiveness to customer demand. This requires careful consideration of warehouse location, labor costs, and compliance with *local warehousing regulations*. * Exploring alternative shipping routes, like the Suez Canal, and their associated costs, including potential *Suez Canal Authority transit fees*. **Problem:** GlobalTech Solutions must develop a robust and cost-effective strategy to mitigate the risks associated with unpredictable transit times, port congestion, and increasing costs in its Asia-Europe container shipping operations. The company needs to balance the need for reliable delivery times to meet customer expectations with the pressure to minimize logistics costs and maintain profitability. The current contract with OceanWave Shipping, while initially attractive, is proving inadequate in the face of current operational challenges. GlobalTech needs to make critical decisions on its shipping strategy, port selection, and distribution network to ensure the continued success of its European and Baltic operations. The company must also ensure full compliance with all relevant international and regional regulations, including those related to maritime transport, customs, and security. Failure to comply could result in significant fines, delays, and reputational damage.\n",
