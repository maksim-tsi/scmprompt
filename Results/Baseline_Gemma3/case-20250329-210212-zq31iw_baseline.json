  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **OceanExs Baltic Gamble: Navigating Supply Chain Disruptions and IMO 2020 Compliance**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** OceanEx Logistics, a rapidly growing freight forwarder headquartered in Shanghai, is experiencing significant challenges fulfilling its contracts for delivering consumer electronics from various manufacturing hubs in China (Shenzhen, Ningbo, Qingdao) to distribution centers in Northern Europe and the Baltic region. The company specializes in Full Container Load (FCL) shipments and prides itself on competitive pricing and reliable service. However, recent events have exposed vulnerabilities in its supply chain, threatening profitability and customer relationships. **Key Entities:** * **OceanEx Logistics:** Shanghai-based freight forwarder. Key contact: Ms. Li Wei, Head of European Operations. * **Golden Dragon Shipping Lines (GDSL):** A major container shipping line operating on the Asia-Europe trade lane. OceanEx is a significant customer. Vessel example: GDSL Phoenix, a 14,000 TEU container ship. GDSL is struggling with increased costs related to IMO 2020 regulations regarding low-sulfur fuel, impacting their surcharges. * **Northern European Distribution Centers:** Located in Rotterdam (Netherlands), Hamburg (Germany), and Gdansk (Poland), serving various retailers of consumer electronics. These centers are subject to EU customs regulations and require specific documentation for import clearance (see below). * **Manufacturing Hubs in China:** Shenzhen, Ningbo, and Qingdao. These hubs are subject to Chinese export regulations requiring accurate customs declarations and export licenses. * **Port of Klaipeda (Lithuania):** Increasingly used as a gateway to the Baltic region, offering potentially faster transit times to some customers. However, limited capacity for VLCCs requires transshipment via feeder vessels. * **Baltic Transports Ltd.:** A trucking company specializing in container transport from Baltic ports to inland destinations. They are facing increased operational costs due to EU regulations on driver working hours and emissions standards for trucks. **Operational Challenges:** * **Port Congestion (Rotterdam):** Severe congestion at the Port of Rotterdam is causing significant delays. Vessels are experiencing berthing delays of up to 5 days, impacting onward transportation and causing missed delivery windows. The GDSL Phoenix recently suffered a week-long delay. This congestion also increases the risk of customs inspections and delays due to random checks targeting high-risk shipments as part of the EU's security measures. * **Suez Canal Disruptions:** Increased geopolitical instability in the Red Sea has led to rerouting of vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, adding 10-14 days to transit times and significantly increasing fuel costs. GDSL has implemented a temporary surcharge to cover these costs. *This also necessitates adjustments to documentation, specifically amending Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) notifications to customs authorities.* * **Trucking Capacity Constraints:** Growing demand for trucking services in Northern Europe, coupled with driver shortages, rising fuel prices, and stricter EU regulations on driver hours and emissions, are driving up trucking costs and causing delays in inland transportation from Rotterdam and Hamburg. Baltic Transports Ltd. has quoted significantly higher rates than budgeted for. *They are also requiring longer lead times for booking trucks, impacting delivery schedules.* * **Klaipeda Alternative:** OceanEx is considering using the Port of Klaipeda as an alternative gateway to the Baltic region. However, Klaipeda has limited capacity for handling very large container ships (VLCCs) like the GDSL Phoenix, and transshipment via smaller feeder vessels would be required, adding to costs and potentially increasing the risk of damage. *Furthermore, transshipment requires additional documentation, including a transshipment manifest, adding complexity to the import workflow.* * **IMO 2020 Compliance:** GDSL is incurring significant costs to comply with the IMO 2020 regulations limiting sulfur content in marine fuels. This has resulted in Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF) surcharges, impacting OceanEx's overall shipping costs. *OceanEx needs to understand how this surcharge is calculated and whether it is justified based on GDSL's fuel consumption data.* * **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Several key customers, including a major electronics retailer with a distribution center near Warsaw, have expressed strong dissatisfaction with recent delays and increased shipping costs. They are threatening to switch to competing freight forwarders. *These customers are demanding compensation for late deliveries based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in their contracts.* **The Problem:** OceanEx Logistics faces a critical decision: how to optimize its supply chain to mitigate the impact of port congestion, Suez Canal disruptions, IMO 2020 compliance costs, and trucking capacity constraints, while maintaining competitive pricing and ensuring timely delivery to its customers in Northern Europe and the Baltic region. Ms. Li Wei needs to analyze the available options, including the use of alternative ports like Klaipeda (considering the transshipment implications), renegotiate contracts with GDSL and Baltic Transports Ltd. (factoring in IMO 2020 BAF and EU trucking regulations), and potentially adjust pricing strategies to maintain profitability and customer satisfaction. She must also ensure compliance with all relevant international regulations (IMO 2020, EU customs), Chinese export regulations, and specific port requirements. She must develop a robust and cost-effective solution within the next two weeks to present to OceanEx's senior management. Failure to do so risks losing key customers and damaging OceanEx's reputation. **Specifically, Ms. Li Wei must consider the following documentation requirements:** * **Standard Import Documentation (EU):** Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Bill of Lading, Customs Declaration (SAD - Single Administrative Document), Certificate of Origin. These need to be accurate and complete to avoid customs delays. * **Security Documentation:** ISPS Compliance documentation (including vessel security plan verification), Advance Manifest filing (ENS - Entry Summary Declaration) with EU customs authorities. * **Transshipment Documentation (if using Klaipeda):** Transshipment Manifest, feeder vessel documentation. * **Compliance Documentation:** Evidence of compliance with IMO 2020 regulations (GDSL fuel consumption reports, BAF surcharge justification), documentation related to EU trucking regulations (driver logs, emissions certifications). **Ms. Li Wei needs to create a comprehensive checklist for each shipment, ensuring all necessary documentation is prepared accurately and submitted on time to avoid delays and penalties. She also needs to evaluate the potential benefits of implementing a Port Community System (PCS) to streamline the import documentation workflow and improve communication with customs authorities and port operators.**\n",
