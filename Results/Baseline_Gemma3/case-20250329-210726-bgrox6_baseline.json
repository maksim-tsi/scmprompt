  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Frozen Assets: Navigating Baltic Seafood Import Challenges\n\nCASE Description:\n**Background:** Nordic Seafood Importers (NSI), a leading distributor of premium seafood across Scandinavia and the Baltic states, is facing a critical challenge in its container shipping logistics. Based in Gothenburg, Sweden, NSI sources a significant portion of its frozen tuna and salmon from fisheries in the Western Pacific, primarily around Japan and Taiwan. The company relies heavily on container shipments through major Asian ports like Yokohama and Kaohsiung to reach Northern Europe. NSI has a long-standing relationship with \"EverOcean Lines,\" a large container shipping company operating a regular service between Asia and Northern Europe. EverOcean utilizes a fleet of modern container vessels, including the fictional *EverOcean Baltic*, a 14,000 TEU vessel deployed on the \"Asia-North Europe Express\" route. This route typically involves calls at major ports like Singapore, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and finally, Gothenburg. **The Problem:** Recently, NSI has experienced a series of disruptions and increasing costs associated with its container shipments. Specifically: * **Port Congestion:** Severe congestion at both Rotterdam and Hamburg has led to significant delays in unloading and onward transportation to NSI's distribution center in Gothenburg. This congestion is exacerbated by unpredictable weather conditions in the North Sea, causing further scheduling issues. Delays have resulted in spoiled shipments of high-value tuna and salmon, causing significant financial losses. This congestion also impacts the ability to efficiently handle import containers, leading to increased container storage costs (Datapoint 15). * **Rising Transshipment Costs:** EverOcean Lines has recently implemented a new \"Baltic Feeder Surcharge\" due to increased operational costs and delays associated with feeder services from Hamburg and Rotterdam to Gothenburg. This surcharge, coupled with increasing fuel prices, has significantly increased NSI's transportation costs. * **Competition from New Entrants:** Several smaller, regional seafood importers have begun utilizing alternative, smaller ports in the Baltic Sea, such as Klaipeda (Lithuania) and Gdynia (Poland). These ports offer faster customs clearance and potentially lower handling fees, putting pressure on NSI's competitive advantage. These ports are also potentially subject to different environmental regulations, adding complexity. * **Lack of Transparency & Regulatory Compliance:** NSI lacks real-time visibility into the location and condition of its containers once they leave Asia. They rely heavily on EverOcean Lines' tracking system, which often provides inaccurate or delayed information. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to proactively manage potential disruptions and inform customers about shipment delays. Furthermore, NSI must ensure compliance with the Entry Summary Declaration (ENS) requirements (Datapoint 2) *before* the goods are even loaded in Asia. This includes providing accurate and complete information to EU customs authorities to avoid potential delays and penalties upon arrival. The absence of a robust system for managing and verifying ENS data increases this risk. They must consider the Latvian Customs (VID) requirements (Datapoint 9) when importing through Riga, which may differ from Swedish customs procedures. * **Customs Clearance Delays and Documentation Issues:** NSI has experienced increasing delays in customs clearance at Rotterdam and Hamburg, potentially due to incomplete or inaccurate documentation. As an importer, NSI is ultimately responsible for providing all necessary documentation for customs clearance (Datapoint 10). This includes the Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice, Packing List, and other required permits and certificates. NSI must also work closely with its customs broker (Datapoint 5) to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and to expedite the clearance process. These delays also affect the timely delivery to the customer (Datapoint 6). **The Challenge:** NSI's CEO, Solveig Andersson, is concerned about the long-term impact of these logistical challenges on the company's profitability and reputation. She has tasked her logistics team with identifying and evaluating alternative solutions to improve the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of NSI's container shipping logistics between Asia and Northern Europe/Baltic. The team must consider: * **Alternative Port Options in the Baltic Sea:** Evaluating the feasibility of utilizing ports like Klaipeda, Gdynia, or Riga, considering factors such as port infrastructure, customs procedures, feeder service availability, and potential cost savings. This includes understanding the specific requirements of Latvian Customs (VID) for imports through Riga (Datapoint 9). * **Negotiating Better Terms with EverOcean Lines or Exploring Partnerships with Other Shipping Companies:** Negotiating more favorable rates and service levels with EverOcean Lines, or exploring alternative shipping options with other carriers. This includes considering the roles and responsibilities of shippers, carriers, and consignees (Datapoint 13) and the potential for improved collaboration. * **Implementing a More Robust Tracking and Monitoring System to Improve Shipment Visibility:** Investing in a tracking and monitoring system that provides real-time visibility into the location and condition of containers, allowing NSI to proactively manage potential disruptions and inform customers about shipment delays. * **Evaluating the Feasibility of Establishing a Regional Distribution Center in a Baltic Port to Bypass Congestion in Rotterdam and Hamburg:** Assessing the costs and benefits of establishing a regional distribution center in a Baltic port, such as Klaipeda or Riga, to bypass congestion in Rotterdam and Hamburg and improve delivery times to customers in the Baltic states. * **Assessing the Potential Environmental Impact of Different Transportation Options and Considering More Sustainable Alternatives:** Evaluating the environmental impact of different transportation options, such as using more fuel-efficient vessels or shifting to rail transport, and considering more sustainable alternatives to reduce NSI's carbon footprint. This should take into consideration regulations like the Marine Environment Protection Law (Datapoint 8), especially if considering routes through areas like Yangshan. * **Addressing Documentation and Customs Clearance Issues:** Implementing a system for ensuring accurate and complete documentation for all shipments, including the Entry Summary Declaration (ENS), Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice, and Packing List. This includes working closely with customs brokers to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and to expedite the clearance process (Datapoint 5, 10). Understanding the roles of shipping agents and terminals (Datapoint 14) is also essential. Solveig needs a clear and actionable plan to address these challenges and ensure that NSI can continue to deliver high-quality seafood to its customers on time and at a competitive price, while also adhering to all relevant regulatory requirements.\n",
