  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Reefer Madness: Navigating Baltic Port Congestion and Temperature-Sensitive Seafood\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Nordic Seafood Imports (NSI), a major importer of fresh and frozen seafood into the Baltic region, is facing significant disruptions to its supply chain. NSI relies heavily on container shipping from various ports in Southeast Asia, primarily Vietnam and Thailand, to meet the growing consumer demand for seafood in Scandinavia and the Baltics. The company faces not only operational challenges but also regulatory hurdles related to international maritime transportation and customs compliance. **Key Entities:** * **Klaus Andersson:** Head of Logistics at NSI, responsible for ensuring timely and cost-effective delivery of seafood, while adhering to all relevant import and transportation regulations. * **Ingrid Svensson:** NSI's Chief Procurement Officer, tasked with securing competitive freight rates, managing relationships with shipping lines, and ensuring compliance with international trade agreements and customs regulations. * **Captain Anya Petrova:** Master of the \"Baltic Breeze,\" a 6,800 TEU container vessel operated by fictional shipping line, \"Aurora Lines.\" Captain Petrova is responsible for ensuring the vessel and its cargo comply with all applicable maritime regulations, including those pertaining to hazardous goods and environmental protection, particularly within Chinese port areas. * **Port of Gdynia Authority:** The governing body of the Port of Gdynia, Poland, a key transshipment hub for NSI's imports. The Authority is responsible for managing port operations, ensuring security, and enforcing customs regulations. * **TransBaltic Logistics:** A local trucking company contracted by NSI for inland transportation from Gdynia to distribution centers in Sweden, Finland, and the Baltic states. They must comply with EU transportation regulations and customs procedures for cross-border shipments. **Core Operational Challenges:** * **Port Congestion:** The Port of Gdynia, while modernizing, is experiencing increased congestion due to a surge in container traffic driven by the growth of e-commerce and increased trade with Asia. This is leading to vessel delays, increased demurrage charges, and difficulties in securing berthing windows for Aurora Lines' vessels. These delays can lead to violations of regulations regarding perishable goods and customs clearance deadlines. * **Vessel Routing and Scheduling:** Aurora Lines is attempting to optimize its Asia-North Europe/Baltic service routes to mitigate the impact of Gdynia's congestion. The \"Baltic Breeze\" is currently operating on a fixed weekly schedule, calling at Singapore, Port Klang, Colombo, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and Gdynia. Alternative routing options, such as transshipment via larger ports like Rotterdam or Hamburg with feeder services to Gdynia, are being considered but come with their own set of cost and time implications. Any changes to routing must be carefully considered in light of existing contracts with shippers and freight forwarders and potential implications for customs declarations. * **Reefer Container Management:** NSI relies heavily on refrigerated (reefer) containers to maintain the quality and freshness of its seafood cargo. Delays in Gdynia are causing concerns about temperature control and potential spoilage, leading to potential claims and reputational damage. Availability of reefer plugs at the port is also a growing concern. This is further complicated by strict regulations regarding the handling and storage of perishable goods, particularly seafood, to prevent foodborne illnesses. The documentation of temperature logs and compliance with HACCP principles are critical. * **Inland Transportation Bottlenecks:** Even when containers are discharged on time in Gdynia, TransBaltic Logistics is struggling to keep up with demand for inland transportation. A shortage of truck drivers, coupled with border crossing delays (particularly between Poland and Lithuania for goods destined to the Baltic states), is further exacerbating the situation. These delays can lead to spoilage of goods and violation of customs regulations regarding timely delivery of imported goods. * **Fuel Costs and Sustainability:** Rising fuel costs are impacting Aurora Lines' profitability and NSI's overall transportation expenses. NSI is also under pressure from its customers and stakeholders to reduce its carbon footprint and adopt more sustainable transportation practices. Aurora Lines is experimenting with slow steaming and alternative fuel options but faces challenges in balancing cost competitiveness with environmental performance. Furthermore, they must comply with environmental regulations, such as the Marine Environment Protection Law, especially when calling at ports like Yangshan. * **Customs and Import Regulations:** NSI must navigate a complex web of customs and import regulations, including tariff classifications, documentation requirements, and inspection procedures. Any errors or omissions in documentation can lead to delays, penalties, and even seizure of goods. NSI is also responsible for verifying the accuracy of information provided by its suppliers and ensuring compliance with import regulations. The 24-hour manifest rule and proper declaration of goods are critical. **The Problem:** Klaus Andersson and Ingrid Svensson at NSI need to develop a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impact of port congestion, inland transportation bottlenecks, rising costs, and regulatory hurdles on their seafood supply chain. They must evaluate alternative routing options, negotiate with Aurora Lines and TransBaltic Logistics, explore opportunities to improve reefer container management, ensure compliance with customs regulations, and consider implementing more sustainable transportation practices, all while ensuring the timely and cost-effective delivery of fresh and frozen seafood to their customers. They must also ensure that they are fully compliant with all relevant regulations related to maritime transportation, customs clearance, and environmental protection. How can NSI navigate the \"Baltic Bottleneck\" and maintain its competitive edge in the face of these growing logistical and regulatory challenges?\n",
