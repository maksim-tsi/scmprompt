  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Baltic Breeze: Navigating Seafood Supply Chain Challenges in the Face of Port Congestion and Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Baltic Breeze Seafood (BBS), a rapidly growing importer of fresh and frozen seafood based in Riga, Latvia, is facing significant challenges in managing its supply chain from Southeast Asia. BBS sources a variety of seafood, including Vannamei shrimp from Vietnam and Yellowfin tuna from the Philippines, destined for distribution throughout the Baltic states and Scandinavia. **Entities:** * Baltic Breeze Seafood (BBS) \u2013 Seafood Importer/Distributor * Vietnamese Shrimp Farms (various independent farms) * Philippine Tuna Fishing Cooperatives (various cooperatives) * OceanTrans Logistics \u2013 Singapore-based Freight Forwarder * \"MV Baltic Mariner\" \u2013 a fictional 6,800 TEU container vessel owned by Neptun Lines * Port of Singapore * Port of Rotterdam * Port of Riga * Cold Storage Baltics (CSB) \u2013 a fictional cold storage warehouse operator with facilities in Riga and Tallinn. * EuroBaltic Haulage \u2013 a fictional trucking company specializing in refrigerated transport. * Latvian Customs (VID) \u2013 The Latvian customs authority responsible for overseeing import and export regulations. **Regulatory Issues:** BBS must adhere to stringent EU food safety regulations, including: * **Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (General Food Law):** Ensures food safety throughout the entire supply chain, including traceability requirements from origin to consumer. BBS must maintain detailed records of all seafood shipments, including supplier information, harvest dates, processing methods, and transportation details. * **Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 (Hygiene of Foodstuffs):** Establishes general hygiene requirements for food businesses, including temperature control, cleaning and disinfection procedures, and pest control measures. BBS and its partners (CSB, EuroBaltic Haulage) must implement HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) principles to identify and control potential food safety hazards. * **Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (Specific Hygiene Rules for Food of Animal Origin):** Lays down specific hygiene rules for the production and placing on the market of products of animal origin, including seafood. This regulation requires BBS to source seafood from approved establishments and ensure that it is handled and processed in accordance with strict hygiene standards. * **EU Fish Traceability Regulation (various implementing regulations):** Mandates complete traceability of fish and seafood products, including species, origin, catch area, and fishing gear used. BBS must provide this information to its customers and ensure that it is readily available to regulatory authorities upon request. * **Customs Regulations (Union Customs Code - UCC):** BBS is subject to the Union Customs Code (UCC) and related national regulations implemented by Latvian Customs (VID). This includes accurate declaration of goods, payment of import duties and VAT, and compliance with import restrictions and prohibitions. * **Border Inspection Post (BIP) Checks:** Seafood shipments are subject to inspection at Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) upon arrival in the EU. These checks may include documentary checks, identity checks, and physical checks to ensure compliance with EU food safety and veterinary regulations. Failure to meet these requirements can lead to rejection of the shipment. Delays can result in spoilage and rejection of entire shipments, leading to significant financial losses. They also need to navigate the complexities of customs clearance in Latvia, including potential inspections by Latvian Customs (VID). The Port of Riga, as a key entry point, plays a crucial role in facilitating or hindering this process. BBS must also comply with requirements related to *Container Storage Cost* and *Container Storage* at the port, ensuring timely removal of containers to avoid additional charges. **Problem:** BBS currently uses OceanTrans Logistics to consolidate their shipments in Singapore. The \"MV Baltic Mariner\", operated by Neptun Lines, then transports the containers to Rotterdam. From Rotterdam, EuroBaltic Haulage trucks the seafood to CSB's cold storage facility in Riga. While this route has been relatively reliable, BBS is experiencing increasing delays and rising costs due to several factors: * **Congestion at Rotterdam:** The Port of Rotterdam is experiencing significant congestion, particularly during peak seasons, leading to delays in unloading the \"MV Baltic Mariner\" and subsequent trucking to Riga. These delays have occasionally resulted in seafood shipments exceeding acceptable temperature limits, causing spoilage and costly insurance claims. This also leads to increased *Container Storage Cost* at the port. * **Seasonal Fluctuations:** The demand for seafood fluctuates significantly throughout the year, peaking during the holiday season (November-December) and summer months (June-August). BBS is struggling to accurately forecast demand and manage inventory levels, leading to either stockouts or excessive holding costs. * **Rising Fuel Costs:** The increasing cost of fuel is impacting both the ocean freight rates charged by Neptun Lines and the trucking rates charged by EuroBaltic Haulage, significantly increasing BBS's overall transportation expenses. * **Port of Riga Capacity:** While the Port of Riga is closer and theoretically more efficient, it has limited capacity for handling large container vessels like the \"MV Baltic Mariner\". Direct calls to Riga are infrequent and potentially more expensive than transshipment via Rotterdam. *Container Transhipment* at the Port of Riga may present an opportunity, but requires careful consideration of costs and efficiency. The *Container Terminal (Port of Riga)* needs to be assessed for its efficiency. BBS is also concerned about potential delays due to customs inspections by Latvian Customs (VID). Increased scrutiny of seafood imports, combined with potential errors in documentation (e.g., inaccurate Bill of Lading information, missing health certificates), could lead to lengthy delays and costly penalties. BBS needs to evaluate alternative solutions to mitigate these challenges and optimize its supply chain. Specifically, they are considering: * **Exploring alternative port options:** Are there other North Sea or Baltic ports (e.g., Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Gdansk, Klaipeda) that could offer faster and more reliable transshipment options than Rotterdam, even if they involve slightly longer trucking distances to Riga? The *Port Cooperation Agreement*s in place should be considered when selecting alternative ports. * **Negotiating direct calls to Riga:** Can BBS negotiate a contract with Neptun Lines or another shipping line to secure more frequent and cost-effective direct calls to the Port of Riga, potentially using smaller vessels? They need to consider the *Port of Riga* capacity and infrastructure limitations. * **Improving demand forecasting:** Can BBS implement better demand forecasting techniques to more accurately predict seasonal fluctuations and optimize inventory levels at CSB's cold storage facility? * **Exploring alternative transportation modes:** Could rail transport from Rotterdam to Riga or another Baltic port offer a more cost-effective and reliable alternative to trucking, despite potentially longer transit times? * **Optimizing Customs Clearance:** Can BBS improve its customs clearance procedures to minimize the risk of delays and penalties? This includes ensuring accurate and complete documentation, utilizing electronic data interchange (EDI) for faster data transmission, and establishing a strong relationship with Latvian Customs (VID). Engaging a skilled *Customs Broker* or *Importer/Exporter/Customs Broker* could be beneficial. BBS must analyze these options, considering factors such as cost, transit time, reliability, regulatory compliance, and the potential for disruptions, to develop a resilient and efficient supply chain that can meet the growing demand for its seafood products while minimizing risks and maximizing profitability. They need to consider the impact on *Shippers, Freight Forwarders* and the overall *International - Trade/Shipping* landscape. They also need to evaluate the *Export Container/Terminal Operator/Yard* options at the ports under consideration.\n",
