  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: The Spoiled Salmon Scenario: Navigating the Baltic Supply Chain Maze\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Nordic Seafood Importers (NSI), a leading distributor of fresh and frozen seafood across Northern Europe and the Baltic states, is facing a critical problem with its containerized supply chain originating from Southeast Asia. NSI relies heavily on the \u201cDragon\u2019s Breath\u201d service operated by Pacific Star Lines (PSL), a major container shipping company. The Dragon\u2019s Breath connects key Southeast Asian ports with the Port of Rotterdam, from where NSI then transships the goods to smaller Baltic ports, primarily Riga (Latvia) and Gdynia (Poland). A typical shipment involves temperature-controlled containers carrying fresh salmon and other seafood delicacies. Recently, NSI has experienced significant delays and increased costs due to persistent congestion at the Port of Rotterdam and subsequent challenges in securing timely feeder vessel slots to the Baltic. This is severely impacting NSI\u2019s ability to deliver fresh seafood to its customers within the required timeframes, leading to spoiled product, contract penalties, and reputational damage. The situation is further complicated by the specific requirements for importing perishable goods into the EU and Latvia, including stringent veterinary checks and adherence to EU Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. These regulations require NSI to maintain full traceability of its seafood products throughout the entire supply chain. **Key Entities Involved:** * **Nordic Seafood Importers (NSI):** A seafood distribution company based in Stockholm, Sweden, reliant on timely shipments from Southeast Asia. Key contact: Ingrid Bergman, Head of Logistics. * **Pacific Star Lines (PSL):** A major container shipping company operating the \"Dragon's Breath\" service. Key contact: Jian Li, Account Manager for NSI. * **Port of Rotterdam:** A major European port experiencing congestion issues. * **Riga Universal Terminal (RUT):** A terminal in the Port of Riga. Subject to labor disputes that delay offloading and clearance. * **Baltic Feeder Service (BFS):** A feeder vessel operator providing transshipment services from Rotterdam to Baltic ports, operating vessels like the *MS Baltic Breeze*. * **Gdynia Container Terminal (GCT):** A terminal in the Port of Gdynia. * **Latvian Customs (VID):** The customs authority responsible for enforcing import regulations in Latvia. They require specific documentation including a correctly completed Single Administrative Document (SAD) and potentially physical inspections of the goods. * **Veterinary Border Control Post (VBCP) at Riga:** Responsible for conducting veterinary checks on imported seafood to ensure compliance with EU food safety regulations. **Core Operational Challenges:** * **Rotterdam Congestion:** Increased container volumes, labor shortages, and infrastructure limitations at the Port of Rotterdam lead to delays in unloading and transshipment. PSL\u2019s Dragon\u2019s Breath service is frequently affected, resulting in missed feeder vessel connections. *This impacts NSI's ability to meet the required 48-hour window for transshipping perishable goods.* * **Feeder Vessel Capacity Constraints:** Limited feeder vessel capacity from Rotterdam to Riga and Gdynia, particularly for refrigerated containers (reefers), exacerbates the problem. BFS is struggling to meet the increasing demand. * **Port Labor Disputes:** Recurring labor disputes at Riga Universal Terminal (RUT) further delay the offloading and clearance of containers destined for Latvia, affecting NSI\u2019s ability to deliver to its Latvian customers. *Delays increase the risk of spoilage and necessitate closer coordination with Latvian Customs (VID) to avoid penalties.* * **Rising Transportation Costs:** Delays and increased demand for feeder services have driven up transportation costs, impacting NSI's profit margins. * **Customs and Veterinary Clearance Delays:** Increased scrutiny and potential physical inspections by Latvian Customs (VID) and the Veterinary Border Control Post (VBCP) in Riga can lead to further delays, particularly if documentation is incomplete or inaccurate. *A missing Health Certificate, as required under EU regulations for importing animal products, could result in the entire shipment being rejected or destroyed.* * **Inaccurate or Incomplete Bill of Lading (B/L):** Errors in the Bill of Lading, such as incorrect weight or description of goods, can lead to customs delays and penalties. Specifically, discrepancies between the B/L and the commercial invoice will trigger customs scrutiny. *This highlights the need for accurate data entry and verification throughout the shipping process.* NSI must also ensure that the B/L includes accurate information about the container's temperature settings and the type of refrigerant used. **Problem to be Solved:** Ingrid Bergman, Head of Logistics at NSI, needs to develop a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impact of the Baltic bottleneck and ensure the timely and cost-effective delivery of seafood to NSI\u2019s customers in the Baltic region. This includes evaluating alternative shipping routes (e.g., direct shipments to Baltic ports), negotiating better terms with PSL and BFS (including guaranteed reefer container slots), exploring alternative port options in the Baltic (e.g., Klaipeda, Lithuania), and implementing contingency plans to minimize the impact of potential disruptions (e.g., cold storage facilities near ports). Furthermore, Ingrid must address the specific regulatory challenges associated with importing perishable goods into the EU and Latvia. This includes: * **Ensuring full compliance with EU food safety regulations (EC) No 178/2002, including traceability requirements.** * **Implementing robust documentation procedures to avoid delays at Latvian Customs (VID), including accurate and complete Bills of Lading, Commercial Invoices, Packing Lists, and Health Certificates.** * **Establishing clear communication channels with the Veterinary Border Control Post (VBCP) in Riga to facilitate smooth and efficient veterinary checks.** * **Developing a risk assessment framework to identify and mitigate potential supply chain disruptions, considering factors such as port congestion, labor disputes, and customs inspections.** NSI needs a robust and resilient supply chain solution to maintain its competitive edge in the demanding seafood market and avoid costly product spoilage and penalties. This requires a proactive approach to supply chain management, leveraging technology, data analytics, and strong relationships with key stakeholders to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of its products.\n",
