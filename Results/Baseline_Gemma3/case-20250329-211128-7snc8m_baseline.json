  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: BaltOrient Seafood: Navigating Supply Chain Challenges in the Baltic Seafood Market\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** BaltOrient Seafood, a rapidly growing seafood distributor based in Riga, Latvia, is facing significant challenges scaling its supply chain to meet increasing demand for high-quality, frozen seafood sourced from Southeast Asia. They specialize in supplying restaurants and supermarkets throughout the Baltic region and Northern Europe. **Entities:** * BaltOrient Seafood (Importer/Distributor) * Southeast Asian Seafood Suppliers (various locations in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia) * OceanEx Logistics (Singapore-based freight forwarder) * \"Northern Star\" container vessel, owned by Baltic Sea Lines (fictional shipping line) * Port of Singapore * Port of Rotterdam * Port of Riga * EuroCold Logistics (Rotterdam-based cold storage and distribution company) * Latvian Customs Authority (oversees import regulations and compliance) **Operational Challenges:** BaltOrient currently relies on OceanEx Logistics to consolidate its seafood shipments from various Southeast Asian suppliers in Singapore. The consolidated containers are then shipped via \"Northern Star\" to Rotterdam. In Rotterdam, EuroCold Logistics handles customs clearance, cold storage, and onward distribution to BaltOrient\u2019s warehouse in Riga via truck. Several problems have emerged, exacerbated by the complexities of international trade and regulatory compliance: 1. **Increasing Congestion in Rotterdam & Customs Delays:** Delays at the Port of Rotterdam are becoming frequent, leading to missed delivery deadlines and spoilage risks for temperature-sensitive seafood. Congestion surcharges are also adding significant costs. Furthermore, increased scrutiny from customs authorities, stemming from heightened focus on food safety and security, is causing additional delays. BaltOrient needs to ensure all shipments comply with **EU Regulation (EC) No 178/2002** laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. This includes proper documentation and traceability. 2. **Limited Cold Storage Capacity in Riga & Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Compliance:** BaltOrient\u2019s current cold storage facility in Riga is nearing capacity, making it difficult to efficiently handle large shipments from Rotterdam. Expanding the facility will require significant capital investment and permitting delays. Moreover, the facility must adhere to strict **EU Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) regulations** to prevent contamination and ensure food safety. This includes regular inspections and compliance with HACCP principles. 3. **Seasonal Demand Fluctuations & Accurate Forecasting for Perishable Goods:** Demand for certain seafood products spikes significantly during the Christmas and summer holiday seasons. BaltOrient struggles to accurately forecast these peaks and often faces stockouts or excessive inventory. Given the perishable nature of the seafood, accurate forecasting is crucial to minimize waste and maximize profitability. This necessitates a robust demand forecasting model that considers historical data, market trends, and promotional activities. 4. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility & Compliance with Customs Regulations:** BaltOrient lacks real-time visibility into the location and temperature of its shipments throughout the supply chain. This makes it difficult to proactively address potential disruptions and maintain product quality. They currently rely on emailed updates from OceanEx and EuroCold, which are often delayed and incomplete. This lack of visibility also hinders their ability to comply with customs regulations, specifically the requirement to provide accurate and timely information about the goods being imported. Failing to comply with **EU Customs Code (UCC)** can result in penalties and delays. They need to implement a track and trace system that complies with **EU guidelines on electronic data interchange (EDI)** for customs declarations. 5. **Rising Transportation Costs & Impact of Incoterms:** The cost of trucking from Rotterdam to Riga has steadily increased due to rising fuel prices and driver shortages. BaltOrient needs to re-evaluate its transportation strategy and explore alternative modes of transport, such as rail or short-sea shipping. Additionally, BaltOrient must carefully consider the **Incoterms** used in its contracts with suppliers, as these terms define the responsibilities for transportation costs and risks. For example, switching from CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) to FOB (Free on Board) could shift more responsibility for transportation to BaltOrient, potentially impacting their overall costs and control. **The Problem:** BaltOrient Seafood needs to develop a more robust and cost-effective supply chain strategy to address these operational challenges. They need to consider alternative shipping routes, potentially including direct shipments to the Port of Riga, explore options for expanding cold storage capacity while ensuring SPS compliance, and implement a system for real-time supply chain visibility that integrates with customs authorities' EDI systems. They must also develop a more accurate demand forecasting model to better manage seasonal fluctuations and minimize waste. The CEO, Anya Petrova, needs a detailed proposal outlining potential solutions, their costs, benefits, and risks, so she can make informed decisions about the company's future logistics strategy. She is particularly concerned about maintaining the high quality of the seafood, complying with EU regulations (including food safety, customs, and SPS requirements), and meeting increasingly demanding customer expectations. The proposal should also address the implications of different Incoterms on their supply chain operations and costs. Anya also needs to ensure that all relevant parties in the supply chain are aware of and adhering to the required documentation and security protocols.\n",
