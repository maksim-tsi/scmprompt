  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Klaipeda Congestion: A Perfect Storm for BaltiCon Lines**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Case Study: BaltiCon Lines - The Klaipeda Congestion Crisis** **Scenario:** BaltiCon Lines, a mid-sized container shipping company headquartered in Hamburg, Germany, specializes in feeder services between major North Sea ports and the Baltic Sea region. They are experiencing significant operational disruptions and increasing costs due to severe congestion at the Port of Klaipeda, Lithuania, a crucial hub for their Baltic operations. This congestion is impacting their ability to maintain scheduled services and is leading to customer dissatisfaction. **Key Entities:** * **BaltiCon Lines:** Container shipping company operating feeder services. Key personnel include Captain Ingrid Volkov (Head of Operations) and Lars Olsen (Commercial Director). * **Port of Klaipeda (KLP):** A major container port in Lithuania, handling significant volumes of cargo destined for the Baltic region. * **\"MS Baltic Breeze\":** A BaltiCon Lines owned 1,700 TEU container vessel regularly calling at Klaipeda. * **ScanLogistics AB:** A large Swedish freight forwarding company and a key BaltiCon Lines customer, reliant on timely deliveries through Klaipeda for their clients in Scandinavia and the Baltic States. * **Krantas Terminal:** The primary container terminal operator within the Port of Klaipeda. **Operational Challenges:** * **Increased Vessel Waiting Times:** The \"MS Baltic Breeze\" and other BaltiCon vessels are experiencing average waiting times of 36-48 hours before being able to berth at Krantas Terminal in Klaipeda. This is significantly higher than the contracted service level agreement (SLA) of 12 hours. This leads to increased fuel consumption, and potential penalties under the port's vessel traffic management regulations (specifically Article 12 of the Klaipeda Port Authority regulations, which stipulates penalties for vessels causing undue delays). * **Terminal Congestion:** Krantas Terminal is consistently operating at or above its designed capacity. Limited yard space, equipment shortages (particularly straddle carriers), and inefficient gate procedures are contributing to the backlog. Trucker gate access issues (related to Datapoint 14) further exacerbate the problem, leading to longer turnaround times for trucks and hindering the flow of containers in and out of the terminal. * **Weather Delays:** The Baltic Sea is prone to severe weather conditions, particularly during the winter months. Ice formation and storms can further exacerbate congestion and disrupt vessel schedules. These delays are now triggering force majeure clauses in some of BaltiCon's contracts with ScanLogistics AB, requiring legal review and potential renegotiation. * **Trucking Delays:** Delays in cargo handling at the terminal are causing bottlenecks for trucking companies, leading to increased costs and longer transit times for inland transportation. ScanLogistics AB has reported significant delays in receiving their containers. These delays are also impacting BaltiCon's ability to meet agreed-upon delivery schedules outlined in their transport agreements, increasing the risk of financial penalties. * **Information Asymmetry:** Real-time visibility of container status and vessel schedules is limited. BaltiCon Lines struggles to obtain accurate information from Krantas Terminal regarding berthing times and cargo availability, hindering their ability to proactively manage disruptions. This lack of transparency also makes it difficult to optimize trucking schedules and coordinate with ScanLogistics AB. * **Customs Clearance Bottlenecks:** Delays in customs clearance are further compounding the congestion (related to Datapoints 1-7). The Lithuanian Customs Authority, while generally efficient, is experiencing increased scrutiny of shipments transiting to and from Russia and Belarus, leading to more frequent inspections and longer cargo dwell times. Incomplete or inaccurate documentation submitted by importers and customs brokers further contributes to the delays. **Core Regulatory Issues:** * **Port Regulations:** Klaipeda Port Authority regulations regarding vessel priority and berthing allocation, particularly concerning vessels carrying perishable goods or dangerous cargo. These regulations prioritize certain vessels, potentially disadvantaging BaltiCon Lines. * **Customs Clearance Procedures:** Lithuanian customs regulations concerning import and export declarations, transit cargo (Datapoint 6), and security requirements. Non-compliance with these regulations can lead to significant delays and penalties. The regulations are based on EU customs law and Lithuanian national law. * **ISPS Code Compliance:** The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code is a mandatory international regulation that ensures security measures are in place to prevent threats to ships and port facilities. BaltiCon Lines and Krantas Terminal must adhere to the ISPS Code, which includes security assessments, security plans, and security training for personnel. Failure to comply can lead to fines and operational disruptions. **Problem:** BaltiCon Lines is facing mounting pressure to address the Klaipeda congestion crisis. The delays are negatively impacting their on-time performance, increasing operational costs (fuel consumption, port fees, detention and demurrage charges), and eroding customer trust, particularly with key clients like ScanLogistics AB. Captain Volkov and Lars Olsen need to develop a strategy to mitigate the impact of the congestion, improve service reliability, and maintain BaltiCon Lines' competitiveness in the Baltic feeder market. They must consider both short-term solutions to alleviate the immediate pressure and long-term strategies to ensure sustainable operations in the face of ongoing congestion at the Port of Klaipeda. They need to present viable options, with clear cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, to the BaltiCon Lines board. These options should include: * **Short-Term Mitigation:** * Negotiating preferential berthing slots with Krantas Terminal, possibly through revised service agreements. * Optimizing vessel schedules to minimize waiting times, potentially rerouting some cargo through alternative ports like Riga (Datapoint 9) even at slightly higher costs. * Improving communication and information sharing with Krantas Terminal to gain better visibility of berthing times and cargo availability. * Working with ScanLogistics AB to adjust delivery schedules and manage customer expectations. * Implementing a \"fast track\" customs clearance program for key clients, requiring meticulous pre-arrival documentation and close coordination with customs brokers. * **Long-Term Strategies:** * Investing in technology to improve supply chain visibility and streamline communication, including exploring blockchain solutions (Datapoint 8, 12) for secure and transparent data exchange. * Diversifying port calls to reduce reliance on Klaipeda, potentially exploring other Baltic ports. * Lobbying the Klaipeda Port Authority and Krantas Terminal for infrastructure improvements and operational enhancements. * Developing stronger relationships with customs authorities to facilitate smoother clearance processes. * Implementing a robust contingency plan to address potential disruptions due to weather or other unforeseen events. The board will be particularly interested in options that address the regulatory compliance issues, improve data quality, and enhance efficiency in the import documentation workflow.\n",
