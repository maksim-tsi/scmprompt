  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Nordic Salmons SushiGo! Challenge: Navigating Reefer Logistics, Regulatory Hurdles, and Unexpected Disruptions**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Nordic Seafood Importers (NSI), a large consortium of fish processing plants across Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, has secured a major new contract to supply frozen salmon to a rapidly expanding chain of sushi restaurants, \"SushiGo!\", across China. The contract requires consistent, high-volume shipments of frozen salmon, primarily from the port of Bergen, Norway, to various ports in China, initially Dalian. **Key Entities:** * Nordic Seafood Importers (NSI) (Shipper): Represents multiple fish processing plants. Responsible for ensuring product quality and compliance with EU regulations for seafood exports. NSI operates under Incoterms CFR (Cost and Freight) Dalian. * Baltic Sea Shipping Lines (BSSL) (Carrier): A medium-sized container shipping company specializing in routes between Northern Europe/Baltic and Asia. Responsible for the safe and timely transport of the cargo, including maintaining the required temperature throughout the voyage. * SushiGo! (Customer): A rapidly expanding chain of sushi restaurants across China. Requires timely delivery of high-quality frozen salmon that meets Chinese import regulations. * Port of Bergen (Departure Port): A major port in Norway. Experienced in handling seafood exports but facing reefer container availability challenges. * Port of Dalian (Arrival Port): A major port in Northern China. Experiencing significant congestion, potentially impacting temperature integrity. Subject to strict Chinese customs and quarantine inspections. * MV Nordlys (Vessel): A BSSL-owned container vessel, currently operating on the Asia-Northern Europe route. * Polar Logistics (Reefer Container Provider): A leasing company specializing in refrigerated containers. Facing high demand and potential shortages at the Port of Bergen. **Core Regulatory Issues:** The seafood shipments are subject to stringent regulations, including: * **EU Regulations:** NSI must comply with EU Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, ensuring HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) principles are followed throughout the production and handling process. They must also obtain health certificates from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) verifying the salmon's safety and origin. * **Chinese Regulations:** SushiGo! and NSI must adhere to the \"Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Entry and Exit Animal and Plant Quarantine.\" This includes obtaining import permits from the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) and ensuring the salmon meets Chinese food safety standards, including maximum residue limits (MRLs) for contaminants. Specific documentation, including a detailed packing list and bill of lading, must be provided to Yangshan Port Customs. Documentation requirements include the Ship's Manifest and Entry Summary Declaration (ENS). * **Temperature Control:** Maintaining a consistent temperature of -18\u00b0C (0\u00b0F) or lower is critical throughout the entire supply chain to prevent spoilage and ensure food safety. Temperature logs from the reefer containers must be available for inspection by both EU and Chinese authorities. Deviation can lead to shipment rejection as per international trade standards. **Operational Challenges:** * **Reefer Container Availability:** NSI requires a large number of high-quality reefer containers equipped with advanced temperature monitoring capabilities. Polar Logistics is experiencing high demand for reefer containers at the Port of Bergen due to seasonal fluctuations and other exporters. Securing enough containers on short notice is proving difficult, potentially delaying the first shipment. NSI must provide accurate forecasts to Polar Logistics to improve container availability. * **Port Congestion at Dalian:** The Port of Dalian is experiencing significant congestion due to increased import volumes. This is causing delays in unloading and potentially affecting the temperature integrity of the frozen salmon if containers are left sitting on the quay for extended periods. Pre-arrival notifications and close coordination with the terminal operator are crucial to minimize delays. * **Unexpected Weather Conditions:** The MV Nordlys is scheduled to transit the Suez Canal in late December. Forecasts indicate potential for severe weather conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, including strong winds and high waves, which could delay the vessel's arrival in Dalian. BSSL needs to monitor weather forecasts closely and consider alternative routing options if necessary. * **Rising Fuel Costs:** Global fuel prices have unexpectedly spiked, significantly impacting BSSL's operating costs. The existing shipping contract with NSI was negotiated before the price increase, and BSSL is concerned about profitability. BSSL needs to explore fuel hedging strategies or renegotiate the contract with NSI to share the increased costs. **Problem to be Solved:** NSI needs to ensure the timely and safe delivery of the first shipment of frozen salmon to SushiGo! in Dalian, overcoming the challenges of reefer container availability, port congestion, potential weather delays, and rising fuel costs, while adhering to all relevant EU and Chinese regulations. They need to work with BSSL to find a cost-effective and reliable solution that satisfies SushiGo!'s requirements and maintains the quality of the perishable goods. This includes navigating the complex documentation requirements for container shipments, including the Bill of Lading, Ship's Manifest, and customs declarations, whilst adapting to potential delays and cost increases. NSI must also ensure that all parties understand their responsibilities under the CFR Incoterms agreement.\n",
