  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: **Baltic Squeeze: Navigating Congestion and Surcharges in Seafood Exports**\n\nCASE Description:\n**Case Study: Baltic Squeeze: Navigating Congestion and Surcharges in Seafood Exports** **Scenario:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods (BBS), a rapidly growing exporter of premium frozen seafood based in Riga, Latvia, is experiencing significant disruptions in its container shipping operations to key Asian markets. Their primary export destinations are Shanghai and Busan, serving a growing demand for high-quality European seafood in the region. BBS relies heavily on the container shipping services offered by \"Oceanic Horizon Lines\" (OHL), a major carrier operating on the Asia-North Europe trade lane. They primarily utilize OHL\u2019s \"Baltic Express\" service, connecting Riga via feeder vessels to Bremerhaven, Germany, where the containers are loaded onto larger mainline vessels bound for Asia. BBS has a contractual agreement with OHL (subject to *INCOTERMS 2020* specifying responsibilities at each stage) for a guaranteed slot allocation on the Baltic Express service and a transit time of approximately 35 days from Riga to Shanghai. The contract stipulates adherence to *EU Regulation 2017/625* concerning official controls to verify compliance with feed and food law, animal health and welfare rules. However, in recent months, BBS has encountered frequent delays, unexpected costs, and regulatory hurdles, impacting their profitability and threatening their relationships with key clients in Asia. **Operational Challenges:** * **Feeder Vessel Delays:** The feeder vessels operating between Riga and Bremerhaven, operated by OHL\u2019s subsidiary, \"Baltic Sea Shuttle,\" are experiencing increasing delays due to port congestion in Riga, equipment shortages (primarily refrigerated containers \u2013 reefers), and unpredictable weather conditions in the Baltic Sea. These delays often result in missed connections with the mainline vessels in Bremerhaven. The delays often stem from incomplete or inaccurate documentation submitted to the Latvian Customs Authority, violating *EU Regulation No 952/2013 (Union Customs Code)* requirements for pre-arrival declarations. * **Mainline Vessel Congestion:** Even when the feeder vessels arrive on time, the mainline vessels are frequently subject to delays in Bremerhaven due to severe congestion at the port's container terminals. This congestion is attributed to a surge in import volumes and limited terminal capacity, but is exacerbated by slow customs clearance processes. The terminal operators cite increased inspections under *EU Regulation 2019/1012* establishing a framework for sustainable market access relating to port services, requiring stricter adherence to documentation and security protocols. * **Reefer Container Shortages:** BBS has consistently struggled to secure an adequate supply of reefer containers, particularly during peak seasons. This shortage forces them to either delay shipments, leading to spoilage and lost sales, or resort to expensive spot market rates for container rentals. OHL blames the container imbalance on delays in Asian ports due to COVID-related disruptions and the stringent requirements for reefer containers outlined in the *International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC)*, impacting container availability and increasing inspection times. * **Unexpected Surcharges:** BBS has been hit with a series of unexpected surcharges from OHL, including congestion surcharges, port security fees (likely related to *ISPS Code* compliance), and fuel adjustment factors (BAF). These surcharges, often imposed with little or no prior notice, have significantly increased their shipping costs and eroded their profit margins. BBS suspects that OHL is using these surcharges to compensate for inefficiencies in their operations and a lack of transparency in their pricing, potentially violating principles of fair trade practices as outlined in *UNCTAD's Model Law on Competition*. * **Communication Breakdown:** BBS experiences difficulties communicating with OHL regarding shipment status updates and resolving issues. The information provided is often inaccurate or delayed, making it difficult for BBS to manage their inventory and keep their customers informed. They have tried escalating the issues to OHL's regional office in Hamburg, but with limited success. This communication breakdown is partly due to a lack of EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) implementation, as recommended by *UNECE Recommendation 25*, hindering real-time visibility and information sharing. * **Competitor Pressure:** Competitors from Norway and Iceland, leveraging more efficient logistics networks and stronger relationships with shipping lines, are gaining market share in the Asian seafood market. These competitors are offering faster delivery times and more competitive pricing, putting further pressure on BBS. These competitors are often leveraging integrated Port Community Systems (PCS) for faster customs clearance, as encouraged by *EU Directive 2010/65/EU* on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States. **The Problem:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods is facing a critical challenge in maintaining its competitiveness in the Asian seafood market due to persistent disruptions and rising costs in its container shipping operations. The company needs to identify the root causes of these problems and develop a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the risks, improve supply chain efficiency, and ensure reliable delivery of its products to its customers in Shanghai and Busan. The company also needs to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and explore opportunities to leverage technology like EDI and PCS to streamline its operations and enhance communication with its partners. A key aspect of this strategy is to review and update their documentation processes to ensure accuracy and timeliness, thereby avoiding delays and penalties associated with customs clearance. **Considerations for Solution:** * **Documentation Review:** BBS should thoroughly review its documentation processes, ensuring accuracy and completeness of all required documents, including the Bill of Lading, commercial invoice, packing list, and health certificates (in compliance with *EU Regulation 2017/625*). * **EDI Implementation:** Implement EDI to improve data accuracy and timeliness, facilitating faster customs clearance and reducing the risk of delays. * **Security Compliance:** Enhance security compliance measures to expedite customs clearance and improve overall supply chain efficiency, adhering to the *ISPS Code* and other relevant security regulations. * **Contract Negotiation:** Renegotiate the contract with OHL to address the issues of unexpected surcharges and ensure transparency in pricing. * **Alternative Shipping Options:** Explore alternative shipping options, including other carriers or routes, to mitigate the risk of relying solely on OHL. * **Port Community System (PCS):** Explore the use of PCS to facilitate communication with port authorities and streamline customs clearance processes.\n",
