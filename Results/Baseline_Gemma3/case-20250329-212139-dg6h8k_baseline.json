  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Baltic Breeze Seafoods: Navigating Supply Chain Disruptions in the Frozen Seafood Export Market\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods, a rapidly growing exporter of premium frozen seafood based in Riga, Latvia, is experiencing significant disruptions in its container shipping operations to key markets in Asia. These disruptions are impacting product quality, delivery timelines, and ultimately, customer satisfaction, threatening the company's ambitious expansion plans. **Entities:** * Baltic Breeze Seafoods (Janis Ozols, CEO; Elina Krumina, Head of Logistics; Peteris Liepins, Sales Director) * Oceanic Vista Lines (OVL), a major container shipping company. Specifically, their regional account manager, Kenji Tanaka. * \"M/V Baltic Trader,\" a fictional but typical 6,800 TEU container vessel operated by OVL, regularly calling at Riga and Rotterdam. * Ningbo Seafood Importers Association (NSIA), a key industry body representing Baltic Breeze's largest customer base in China. **Regulatory Issues:** * Potential impact of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) \u2013 although currently stalled, its future implementation could affect import/export tariffs and procedures. This requires Baltic Breeze to stay informed on trade policy developments and adapt its export strategies accordingly. * Stringent Chinese customs inspections and phytosanitary regulations for imported seafood, including *compliance with General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China (GACC) Decree 248 and 249* regarding registration of overseas food manufacturers and food safety standards. These regulations necessitate meticulous documentation including health certificates, certificates of origin, and detailed product specifications. * Adherence to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations regarding refrigerated containers (reefers), specifically *compliance with the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code* if certain refrigerants are used. This includes regular inspections and maintenance of reefer units to ensure proper functioning and temperature control. * *Compliance with the China's \"International Maritime Transportation Business\" regulations*, which requires foreign companies engaging in maritime transport activities to meet specific licensing and operational requirements. (Datapoint 11) **Problem:** Baltic Breeze Seafoods relies heavily on Oceanic Vista Lines (OVL) for its container shipments from Riga to Ningbo, Shanghai, and Busan. Lately, the \"M/V Baltic Trader,\" a crucial vessel on the Asia-North Europe route, has been experiencing increasing delays, often exceeding 7-10 days per voyage. These delays are compounded by: * Inconsistent reefer container availability in Riga, leading to missed sailing dates. This is often due to *lack of sufficient empty container repositioning* by OVL to meet Baltic Breeze's needs. * Unexpected port congestion at Rotterdam, a key transshipment hub, causing further delays. This is exacerbated by *inefficient terminal operations and customs clearance procedures* at Rotterdam. * Increased instances of temperature fluctuations within the reefer containers during transit, resulting in spoiled product and rejected shipments by the Ningbo Seafood Importers Association (NSIA). This is a direct violation of the NSIA's *quality standards and contractual agreements* with Baltic Breeze, which stipulate specific temperature ranges for frozen seafood. The damage is also resulting in insurance claims and potential legal disputes. * Rising demurrage and detention charges due to the delays in returning empty containers to OVL in Ningbo. This is further complicated by the *varying demurrage and detention policies* implemented by different container lines in Chinese ports. Baltic Breeze must diligently track container movements and negotiate favorable terms with OVL to mitigate these charges. Janis Ozols, CEO of Baltic Breeze, is under immense pressure from Peteris Liepins, the Sales Director, who is facing angry customers in Asia threatening to switch to competing suppliers from Norway and Canada. The NSIA has issued a formal warning, citing repeated quality issues and demanding corrective action. Elina Krumina, Head of Logistics, is struggling to identify the root causes of the problems and implement effective solutions to ensure timely and reliable delivery of their valuable seafood products. She must propose a plan to mitigate these disruptions, maintain product quality, and regain the trust of their Asian customers, all while considering cost-effectiveness and the long-term sustainability of their shipping operations. This plan must address the following: * **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the causes of the delays, reefer malfunctions, and port congestion. This includes analyzing historical shipping data, interviewing OVL personnel, and consulting with industry experts. * **Reefer Container Management:** Implement a proactive reefer container management system, including pre-trip inspections (PTIs), temperature monitoring throughout the voyage, and regular maintenance schedules. This must adhere to IMO guidelines and industry best practices. * **Shipping Route Optimization:** Explore alternative shipping routes and transshipment hubs to minimize delays and port congestion. Consider direct sailings from Riga to Asia, if feasible, or alternative transshipment ports with better efficiency. * **Carrier Diversification:** Evaluate the possibility of diversifying its carrier base to reduce reliance on OVL. This would provide Baltic Breeze with greater flexibility and negotiating power. * **Customer Communication and Relationship Management:** Implement a proactive communication strategy to keep customers informed of any potential delays or quality issues. Offer compensation for spoiled shipments and work closely with the NSIA to address their concerns. * **Documentation and Compliance:** Ensure all export documentation is accurate, complete, and compliant with Chinese customs regulations and phytosanitary requirements. This includes proper labeling, health certificates, and certificates of origin. * **Contract Negotiation:** Renegotiate shipping contracts with OVL to include performance guarantees and penalties for delays and temperature fluctuations. Ensure that demurrage and detention charges are clearly defined and reasonable. * **Technology Adoption:** Explore the use of technology solutions, such as real-time tracking systems and blockchain, to improve supply chain visibility and efficiency. The potential (and partially realized) loss of contracts is threatening the company's profitability and future growth. Elina's plan must demonstrate a clear understanding of the regulatory landscape, the operational challenges, and the customer expectations in the competitive Asian seafood market. Her success hinges on her ability to develop a resilient and sustainable supply chain that can deliver high-quality seafood on time and at a competitive price.\n",
