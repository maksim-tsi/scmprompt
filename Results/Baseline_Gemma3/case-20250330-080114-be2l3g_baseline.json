  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: The Baltic Squeeze: Navigating Congestion, Compliance, and Container Imbalance in the Silk Wave\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** OceanTech Logistics, a mid-sized freight forwarder specializing in container shipments between Asia and Europe, is facing a growing crisis with its \"Silk Wave\" service. This service, launched two years ago, promised reliable and cost-effective transport of goods from major Asian ports (Shanghai, Shenzhen, Busan) to Northern European hubs (Rotterdam, Hamburg) and onward distribution to Baltic ports like Klaipeda and Riga. The crisis is threatening OceanTech's viability and impacting key clients. **Key Entities:** * **OceanTech Logistics:** The freight forwarder managing the shipments. Key personnel include Anya Petrova (Head of Operations), Jan Kowalski (Baltic Region Manager), and Captain Zhao Wei (Master of the MV *Baltic Trader*, a 6,800 TEU container vessel). OceanTech is responsible for ensuring compliance with all relevant international trade regulations, including ISPS Code compliance and adherence to customs reporting requirements. * **Nordic Electronics AS:** A major Scandinavian electronics manufacturer relying on the Silk Wave service to import components from suppliers in Shenzhen. They are a key client of OceanTech and their high-value electronics shipments require strict security protocols. Contact: Lars Olsen (Supply Chain Director). Nordic Electronics requires accurate and timely delivery of components, adhering to Incoterms CIF Rotterdam, with OceanTech responsible for insurance and freight to the port. * **Baltic Polymers SIA:** A Latvian polymer manufacturer exporting finished goods to customers in China. They use the Silk Wave service for return shipments of empty containers and raw materials. Contact: Inga Bergmane (Logistics Manager). Baltic Polymers operates under Incoterms DAP Shanghai for their exports, meaning OceanTech is responsible for delivering the goods to a named place in Shanghai, requiring precise documentation and customs clearance. * **Port of Klaipeda Authority:** Oversees operations at the Port of Klaipeda, a crucial transit point for goods entering and exiting the Baltic region. They are responsible for enforcing Lithuanian customs regulations and ensuring compliance with EU security directives. * **EuroStar Shipping Lines:** The vessel operator chartering the *Baltic Trader* to OceanTech. They are responsible for the safe and secure operation of the vessel and adherence to international maritime regulations, including SOLAS and MARPOL. * **Horizon Customs Brokerage:** A customs brokerage firm handling import/export documentation for OceanTech's clients in the Baltic region. They are responsible for accurate and timely submission of customs declarations and compliance with all relevant import/export regulations, including proper tariff classification and valuation. **Operational Challenges:** The Silk Wave service has been plagued by a series of escalating problems in the last six months: * **Increased Port Congestion:** The Port of Rotterdam has experienced significant congestion due to labor shortages, increased cargo volumes, and stricter enforcement of customs inspections. This causes delays of up to a week for vessels arriving from Asia, directly impacting the *Baltic Trader's* schedule. The congestion also leads to increased demurrage charges for OceanTech. The Port requires a pre-arrival notification (PAN) at least 24 hours before arrival, as per EU regulations, which OceanTech must ensure is accurately completed and submitted. * **Severe Weather Delays:** The Baltic Sea has experienced unusually severe storms during the winter months, leading to further delays and rerouting of vessels. The *Baltic Trader* was forced to divert to Gothenburg for shelter during one particularly violent storm, adding three days to its transit time. This necessitated revisions to the vessel's schedule and notifications to all affected parties, including Nordic Electronics and Baltic Polymers. * **Container Imbalance:** A significant imbalance of container flows has emerged. More containers are arriving in the Baltic region from Asia than are being shipped back, leading to a shortage of empty containers for Baltic Polymers SIA's exports. OceanTech is facing escalating demurrage and detention charges. This imbalance also increases the cost of repositioning empty containers. OceanTech must explore strategies for incentivizing the return of empty containers or finding alternative uses for them in the Baltic region. * **Customs Clearance Issues:** New, stricter customs regulations implemented by the Lithuanian government, aligned with EU directives on enhanced security, have resulted in increased inspection rates and delays in clearing goods through the Port of Klaipeda. This includes stricter scrutiny of the 24-hour advance manifest rule. Nordic Electronics AS has reported significant delays in receiving their components, threatening their production schedule. These delays are often attributed to discrepancies in the Bill of Lading (B/L), such as incorrect weight declarations or missing information about the consignee's EORI number. Horizon Customs Brokerage is struggling to keep up with the increased documentation requirements and inspection rates. * **Rising Fuel Costs:** Global fuel prices have spiked, significantly increasing the operating costs of the *Baltic Trader*. EuroStar Shipping Lines has informed OceanTech that they will be implementing a fuel surcharge, further eroding the profitability of the Silk Wave service. This necessitates a review of OceanTech's pricing strategy and potential negotiation with clients. **The Problem:** Anya Petrova, Head of Operations at OceanTech Logistics, is under immense pressure to resolve these issues. Nordic Electronics AS is threatening to switch to a competitor if the delays are not addressed immediately. Baltic Polymers SIA is facing production shutdowns due to the lack of empty containers. The rising costs and unreliable service are jeopardizing OceanTech's reputation and profitability. Anya needs to develop a comprehensive plan to: 1. **Mitigate the impact of port congestion in Rotterdam and improve schedule reliability:** Explore alternative port options, such as Antwerp-Bruges or Hamburg, and negotiate preferential berthing arrangements. Implement real-time tracking and communication systems to provide accurate ETAs to clients. Consider using a Port Community System (PCS) for improved communication with the Port of Rotterdam. 2. **Address the container imbalance in the Baltic region and ensure sufficient empty containers are available for export shipments:** Implement a container repositioning strategy, potentially offering incentives for returning empty containers or exploring alternative uses for containers in the Baltic region. Negotiate favorable rates with EuroStar Shipping Lines for empty container repositioning. 3. **Streamline customs clearance processes in Klaipeda to minimize delays:** Work closely with Horizon Customs Brokerage to ensure accurate and timely submission of customs declarations. Implement EDI for electronic data exchange with customs authorities. Provide training to staff on the new customs regulations. Ensure all Bills of Lading are meticulously checked for accuracy and completeness, including accurate weight declarations, consignee EORI numbers, and proper cargo descriptions, to avoid delays and penalties. 4. **Manage the impact of rising fuel costs on the profitability of the Silk Wave service:** Implement fuel-efficient routing strategies. Negotiate fuel surcharge agreements with EuroStar Shipping Lines. Explore the possibility of using alternative fuels. Review and adjust pricing strategies to reflect the increased fuel costs. 5. **Maintain customer satisfaction and prevent further loss of business:** Proactively communicate with clients about potential delays and disruptions. Offer flexible shipping options and alternative routes. Provide exceptional customer service and address complaints promptly. Consider offering discounts or other incentives to retain key clients. Failure to address these challenges effectively could lead to the collapse of the Silk Wave service and significant financial losses for OceanTech Logistics. The company's reputation is on the line, and Anya's leadership will be crucial in navigating this crisis.\n",
