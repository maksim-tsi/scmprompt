  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Baltic Breezes Frozen Salmon Fiasco: Maintaining Cold Chain Integrity in EU Exports\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** Baltic Breeze Seafood, a rapidly growing exporter of premium flash-frozen salmon based in Riga, Latvia, has secured a major contract with the \"Edeka Nord\" supermarket chain across Germany and Scandinavia. This contract requires a consistent weekly supply of salmon to distribution centers in Hamburg, Germany, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Baltic Breeze Seafood relies on container shipping for this large-scale operation. **Key Entities:** * **Baltic Breeze Seafood (shipper):** A Latvian company specializing in flash-frozen salmon exports. * **Oceanic Horizon Lines (carrier):** A container shipping company operating routes between Asia and Northern Europe/Baltic. * **Edeka Nord (customer):** A supermarket chain with distribution centers in Hamburg and Gothenburg. * **Riga Cold Storage (RCS):** A cold storage facility in the Port of Riga, used by Baltic Breeze Seafood for pre-shipment storage. * **\"Arctic Voyager\" (vessel):** A fictional container vessel owned by Oceanic Horizon Lines, operating on the Asia-North Europe/Baltic route. * **\"TransBaltic Logistics\" (freight forwarder):** The freight forwarder used by Baltic Breeze Seafood to coordinate shipments. **Core Regulatory Issues & Requirements:** The shipment of frozen food is subject to stringent regulations within the EU, primarily based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) principles, Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, and Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin. These regulations mandate: * **Temperature Control:** Strict adherence to temperature limits throughout the entire supply chain, from production to delivery. For frozen salmon, this typically means maintaining a core temperature of -18\u00b0C (0\u00b0F) or below. * **Temperature Monitoring & Recording:** Continuous temperature monitoring and recording during storage, transportation, and handling. Records must be accurate, readily available, and traceable. * **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation, including: * **Commercial Invoice:** Detailing the goods, quantity, price, and Incoterms. * **Packing List:** Specifying the contents of each container/pallet. * **Health Certificate:** Issued by the Latvian competent authority (likely the Food and Veterinary Service) confirming the salmon's safety and compliance with EU regulations. This certificate must accompany the shipment. * **Bill of Lading:** Serving as proof of shipment and ownership. * **Temperature Records:** Charts or electronic data logs showing the temperature history of the shipment. * **Customs Declarations:** Import declarations for both Germany and Sweden, complying with EU customs regulations. * **Catch Certificates:** To ensure compliance with regulations to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. * **Traceability:** A robust traceability system that allows Baltic Breeze Seafood to track the origin and movement of its products throughout the supply chain. * **Customs Compliance:** Adherence to EU customs regulations, including accurate declarations and payment of duties and taxes. Failure to comply can lead to delays, fines, or seizure of goods. * **Port Health Inspections:** Shipments are subject to inspection by port health authorities in Hamburg and Gothenburg to verify compliance with food safety regulations. Any temperature deviations during transit exceeding the acceptable limits (usually +/- 2\u00b0C) can lead to rejection of the cargo at the destination ports, resulting in significant financial losses, and potential legal ramifications. **Problem to be Solved:** Baltic Breeze Seafood has experienced increasing challenges in maintaining the required temperature integrity during the container shipping process. Recent shipments have arrived in Hamburg and Gothenburg with temperature fluctuations exceeding acceptable limits, leading to rejected pallets and strained relationships with Edeka Nord. Specifically, Edeka Nord has reported instances of salmon arriving with signs of partial thawing and unacceptable texture, directly attributed to temperature excursions. Investigation by TransBaltic Logistics reveals several potential contributing factors: * **Inconsistent Reefer Container Performance:** Oceanic Horizon Lines' reefer containers, particularly on the \"Arctic Voyager,\" have shown variability in temperature control. Data logs from recent shipments indicate that some units struggle to maintain the -18\u00b0C setpoint, especially during the transit through warmer climates (e.g., crossing the Indian Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea). TransBaltic Logistics has also noticed instances where the reefer units' pre-trip inspection (PTI) reports were incomplete or missing. * **Port Delays in Riga:** Congestion at the Port of Riga has sometimes led to delays in loading containers onto the \"Arctic Voyager,\" resulting in longer dwell times at Riga Cold Storage and potential temperature deviations while waiting on the quayside. Specifically, delays exceeding 24 hours have been observed, exposing the containers to ambient temperatures that can compromise the salmon's frozen state, even with the reefer unit running. * **Route Optimization:** The current route of the \"Arctic Voyager,\" which includes a stop in Rotterdam before Hamburg and Gothenburg, adds transit time (an additional 3-4 days) and increases the risk of temperature excursions. The additional handling in Rotterdam also presents an opportunity for temperature breaches. * **Communication Lapses:** There have been instances of delayed communication regarding container status and potential temperature alarms between Oceanic Horizon Lines and TransBaltic Logistics. In one instance, a temperature alarm triggered in the Suez Canal went unnoticed for 12 hours, leading to a significant temperature spike within the container. * **Inadequate Packaging:** The current packaging solution, while sufficient for short-distance transport, may not provide adequate insulation for the extended transit times and varying ambient temperatures experienced on the current shipping route. * **Lack of Real-Time Monitoring:** Baltic Breeze Seafood currently lacks a real-time temperature monitoring system that provides continuous visibility into the container's temperature throughout the journey. They rely solely on the temperature data logs provided by Oceanic Horizon Lines after arrival, which is insufficient for proactive intervention. Baltic Breeze Seafood needs to implement a comprehensive solution to ensure consistent temperature integrity during container shipping, minimizing the risk of cargo rejection and maintaining their contract with Edeka Nord. They need to evaluate different strategies, including: * **Negotiating stricter temperature control guarantees with Oceanic Horizon Lines:** This includes demanding comprehensive pre-trip inspection (PTI) reports for each reefer container, penalties for temperature deviations exceeding acceptable limits, and access to real-time temperature data. Exploring alternative carriers with a proven track record of cold chain integrity is also an option. * **Optimizing the pre-shipment process at Riga Cold Storage:** This includes implementing a \"first-in, first-out\" (FIFO) system to minimize dwell times, investing in insulated container covers for containers awaiting loading, and ensuring that the cold storage facility's temperature is consistently maintained at -20\u00b0C or lower. * **Exploring alternative shipping routes or direct calls to Hamburg/Gothenburg:** Negotiating with Oceanic Horizon Lines for a direct service or exploring alternative routes with fewer transshipments to reduce transit time and handling. * **Improving communication protocols and implementing real-time temperature monitoring:** Implementing a system that provides real-time temperature data, GPS tracking, and automated alerts for temperature deviations. This allows for proactive intervention and corrective action during transit. * **Investing in more robust packaging solutions:** Exploring alternative packaging materials with enhanced insulation properties, such as vacuum-insulated panels (VIPs), to provide better temperature control during transit. * **Reviewing Incoterms:** Consider shifting Incoterms to transfer risk later in the process to better control the product until it is as close to the destination as possible. * **Insurance:** Securing appropriate cargo insurance that covers temperature-related damage and rejection. The challenge lies in balancing cost-effectiveness with the need to guarantee product quality and meet the stringent requirements of their customer and EU regulations. A failure to resolve this issue will result in the loss of a major contract, significant damage to Baltic Breeze Seafood's reputation, and potential legal consequences. Baltic Breeze Seafood must demonstrate due diligence and a commitment to maintaining cold chain integrity to protect its business and ensure the safety and quality of its products.\n",
