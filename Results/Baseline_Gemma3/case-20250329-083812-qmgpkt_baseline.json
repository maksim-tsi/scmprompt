  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: Baltic Breeze Logistics: Navigating Peak Season Storms - A Strategic Shipping Dilemma\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** \"Baltic Breeze Logistics\" (BBL), a rapidly growing importer of Scandinavian furniture and design products, is facing a critical decision regarding its container shipping strategy for the upcoming peak season (August-November). **Key Entities:** * **Baltic Breeze Logistics (BBL):** An importer based in Riga, Latvia, specializing in Scandinavian furniture and design products. BBL sources primarily from manufacturers in Sweden and Finland. BBL must comply with EU customs regulations, including accurate declarations and adherence to safety standards for imported goods. * **Orient Express Shipping Lines (OESL):** A medium-sized container shipping line operating routes between Asia and Northern Europe/Baltic. OESL operates a fleet of container vessels, including the \"OESL Aurora\" (6,800 TEU capacity) and the \"OESL Borealis\" (8,500 TEU capacity). OESL must adhere to international maritime regulations, including the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) safety and security standards (ISPS Code). * **Kexing Manufacturing:** A large Chinese manufacturer of flat-pack furniture components, based in Ningbo, China. Kexing is a key supplier for several of BBL's competitors. Any goods sourced from Kexing must comply with EU product safety regulations and labeling requirements. Importing from China also introduces potential complexities related to tariffs and trade agreements. * **Riga Container Terminal (RCT):** The primary container terminal in Riga, Latvia, handling a significant volume of cargo to and from the Baltic region. RCT must comply with the ISPS Code and ensure efficient cargo handling to minimize delays. * **Port of Gothenburg (GOT):** A major port in Sweden, serving as a crucial transshipment hub for cargo destined for the Baltic Sea. GOT also complies with ISPS and other international shipping safety standards. **Core Operational Challenges:** * **Peak Season Capacity Crunch:** The demand for container shipping from Asia to Europe surges during the peak season, leading to increased freight rates and potential delays. This situation is exacerbated by the limited number of vessels calling directly at Riga, making BBL reliant on transshipment. * **Equipment Shortages:** Empty container availability can be a significant issue in the Baltic region, particularly for shipments back to Asia. This shortage is often linked to imbalances in trade flows and delays in container repositioning. * **Port Congestion:** Both RCT and GOT are prone to congestion during peak periods, impacting vessel turnaround times and overall supply chain efficiency. Congestion can lead to increased demurrage and detention charges. * **Fuel Surcharges:** Fluctuating bunker fuel prices significantly affect shipping costs, and OESL has implemented a variable fuel surcharge (BAF - Bunker Adjustment Factor). These surcharges can be unpredictable and significantly impact BBL's profitability. * **Competition:** BBL faces intense competition from other furniture importers, who may be sourcing from lower-cost suppliers in Asia. These competitors may benefit from economies of scale or more favorable shipping arrangements. **The Problem:** BBL's CEO, Inga Bergman, is concerned about the increasing shipping costs and potential disruptions to their supply chain during the peak season. Currently, BBL relies primarily on OESL's regular service from Ningbo to Riga, transshipping through Gothenburg. OESL has informed BBL of a significant increase in freight rates for the upcoming peak season, citing increased demand and higher fuel costs. The proposed rate increase includes a substantial BAF, which Inga finds particularly concerning. Inga has received a proposal from Kexing Manufacturing to source a portion of their furniture components directly from China. This would allow BBL to potentially reduce costs by consolidating shipments and negotiating directly with shipping lines. However, this would require BBL to manage the logistics of sourcing from a new supplier, including navigating Chinese export regulations, EU import duties, and potentially renegotiating their existing contracts with Scandinavian manufacturers. Sourcing from China would require BBL to accurately classify the imported goods under the Harmonized System (HS) code for customs purposes. Incorrect classification could result in penalties and delays. Inga also knows that OESL is struggling to fill their vessels on the backhaul from Riga to Asia with anything other than empty containers. She suspects there might be an opportunity to negotiate a more favorable rate if she can find a way to help OESL fill some of that empty space. This could involve identifying potential export opportunities from Latvia to Asia or working with other companies to consolidate shipments. Inga needs to analyze the different options available to BBL, including: 1. **Accepting OESL's increased peak season rates:** This option provides stability and avoids the risks associated with switching suppliers or negotiating new agreements. However, it may significantly impact BBL's profitability. BBL must carefully analyze the breakdown of the rate increase, including the base freight rate and the BAF. 2. **Sourcing furniture components from Kexing Manufacturing in China:** This option offers the potential for cost savings but introduces complexities related to sourcing from a new supplier, managing import duties, and ensuring compliance with EU product safety regulations. BBL needs to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis, considering all associated costs, including transportation, import duties, and quality control. 3. **Negotiating a special agreement with OESL to utilize backhaul capacity:** This option could potentially reduce shipping costs by helping OESL fill empty containers on the return journey. BBL needs to identify potential export opportunities or partners to make this option viable. 4. **Exploring alternative shipping lines or routes:** This option could provide access to more competitive rates or more efficient routes. However, it may require BBL to build relationships with new shipping lines and potentially adjust its logistics processes. BBL needs to research alternative shipping lines that serve the Ningbo-Riga route and compare their rates and service offerings. She must consider the costs, risks, and benefits of each option and develop a comprehensive shipping strategy that ensures BBL can meet its customer demand while maintaining profitability during the challenging peak season. The decision must be made within two weeks to secure capacity. Inga must also factor in potential delays due to customs inspections and port congestion when evaluating each option. The chosen strategy must be documented, and its effectiveness monitored throughout the peak season.\n",
