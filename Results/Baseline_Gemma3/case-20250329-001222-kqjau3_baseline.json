  "prompt": "Please provide a solution for the following business case:\n\nTitle: The Baltic Bottleneck: Navigating Congestion and Compliance at OceanWave Logistics\n\nCASE Description:\n**Scenario:** OceanWave Logistics, a rapidly growing e-commerce retailer specializing in handcrafted furniture and artisanal goods, sources a significant portion of its inventory from Southeast Asia. Their primary market is Northern Europe and the Baltic region. OceanWave relies heavily on container shipping to transport goods from factories in Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia to distribution centers in Hamburg, Germany, and Gdynia, Poland. Recently, OceanWave has experienced a surge in demand, particularly for its popular line of teak garden furniture. This increased volume has put immense strain on their existing logistics network, leading to significant delays and escalating costs. The company primarily utilizes the \"Golden Star\" line of container vessels operated by TransGlobal Shipping. These vessels, such as the \"Golden Star Horizon\" (a fictional 14,000 TEU vessel), regularly transit between ports in Southeast Asia (e.g., Laem Chabang, Thailand and Cai Mep, Vietnam) and Northern European hubs. These shipments often include wood products subject to stringent regulations regarding sustainable sourcing and phytosanitary certificates. However, a confluence of factors has created a critical bottleneck: * **Port Congestion in Hamburg:** Due to a combination of labor shortages, increased import volumes from other sectors (especially post-pandemic recovery), and infrastructure limitations, the Port of Hamburg is experiencing severe congestion. Vessels are facing delays of up to 7 days for berthing and unloading, impacting the overall transit time significantly. The \"Golden Star Horizon\" has been repeatedly affected. This congestion also leads to increased demurrage and detention charges for containers held at the port beyond the allotted free time. The port's terminal operating system (TOS), while generally efficient, struggles to handle the surge in volume, causing further delays in container retrieval. * **Increased Fuel Costs:** Global fuel prices have risen sharply, adding to TransGlobal Shipping's operational expenses. This has resulted in increased freight rates for OceanWave. TransGlobal has implemented a bunker adjustment factor (BAF) surcharge, which is directly passed on to OceanWave. * **Container Shortages:** The imbalance of trade flows has led to a shortage of empty containers in Southeast Asia, making it difficult for OceanWave's suppliers to secure containers in a timely manner. This is particularly acute for 40-foot high cube containers, which are essential for transporting the bulky furniture. This shortage is exacerbated by the slow turnaround time of containers due to port congestion in Europe. * **Customs Delays in Gdynia:** While Hamburg is the primary port of entry, a substantial portion of OceanWave's goods are destined for the Baltic market and are transshipped to Gdynia. However, recent changes in Polish customs regulations, specifically the implementation of stricter enforcement of the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) (Regulation (EU) No 995/2010), coupled with increased scrutiny of imported wood products (due to environmental concerns and illegal logging), have resulted in longer customs clearance times in Gdynia. Shipments are being held for inspections, requiring documentation proving the legality and sustainability of the wood. This includes validated Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifications and comprehensive chain-of-custody documentation. Furthermore, the Polish customs authorities are demanding stricter adherence to the 24-hour advance manifest rule, with penalties levied for incomplete or inaccurate data. * **Contractual Obligations:** OceanWave has committed to specific delivery timelines with major retail partners, such as \"Baltic Living\" and \"Scandinavian Home Furnishings,\" and faces significant penalties for late deliveries. These contracts include clauses regarding force majeure events, but the current situation is borderline, and retailers are pushing for compensation due to lost sales. **The Problem:** OceanWave Logistics is facing a crisis. The \"Baltic Bottleneck\" is eroding profit margins, damaging customer relationships, and threatening the company's reputation. The company needs to find a solution to mitigate the impact of these challenges, optimize its supply chain, and ensure timely delivery of goods to its customers while remaining cost-competitive. Furthermore, they need to ensure full compliance with EUTR regulations to avoid costly penalties and reputational damage. **Key Questions to Consider:** * What alternative port strategies can OceanWave explore to bypass congestion in Hamburg, considering factors like cost, infrastructure (e.g., rail connections to Gdynia), and onward transportation? Consider ports like Bremerhaven or Rotterdam. * How can OceanWave improve its container management to reduce the impact of container shortages in Southeast Asia? Strategies could include better forecasting, negotiating priority container allocation with TransGlobal Shipping, or leasing containers directly. * What strategies can OceanWave implement to expedite customs clearance in Gdynia and comply with the new EUTR regulations? This includes ensuring suppliers provide complete and accurate documentation (FSC certifications, chain-of-custody documentation, phytosanitary certificates), engaging with customs brokers specializing in EUTR compliance, and potentially pre-clearing shipments. * How can OceanWave renegotiate contracts with TransGlobal Shipping or explore alternative carriers to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs? This could involve exploring fixed-rate contracts or diversifying their carrier base. * What technology solutions (e.g., real-time tracking using IoT sensors, predictive analytics to forecast delays) can OceanWave leverage to improve visibility and proactively manage disruptions? Consider implementing a Transportation Management System (TMS). * Should OceanWave consider diversifying its sourcing strategy to reduce reliance on Southeast Asia? This would involve evaluating alternative sourcing locations, considering factors like cost, quality, and sustainability. * What is the financial impact of each potential solution, and what is the best course of action to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction? Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis of each option. Consider the impact on inventory holding costs due to delays. * How can OceanWave ensure compliance with the ISPM 15 standard for wood packaging to avoid delays and penalties related to pest infestations? * What is the impact of the potential implementation of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on OceanWave's supply chain and how can they prepare for it?\n",
