# CASE: The Great Bite Peach Company

An item in today’s issue of *Maritime Outlook Weekly* says:

“The first quarter is historically slow for shippers of cargo between Asia and the United States, but ocean carriers in trans–Pacific trades are betting that volumes will rise soon enough—and strong enough—to allow for a $300 rate increase per container on eastbound freight and a second increase in west-bound rates for refrigerated products.

“While importers are relying on the reality of several new entrants to keep tonnage at high levels—a fact that usually mitigates against rate increases—exporters are more realistic that the new increases will hold, coming as they do on the heels of the apparent recovery of Asian economies.

“Carriers, meanwhile maintain that U.S. exports of perishable meat and produce shipments to Asia are growing apace with the region’s return to normalcy after the late 1990s economic crisis. As they begin to redeploy costly refrigerated containers in the Pacific along with specially trained personnel necessary to operate, maintain, and repair them, carriers are looking to improve freight rates on westbound hauls.

“Container lines say they have seen increases in reefer cargo volumes ranging from 5 to 11 percent, depending on commodity. They expect the trend to continue for the next six to twelve months as Asian economies strengthen and consumer demand for fresh and chilled meat, fruits, and vegetables from the Americas increases.

“The major carriers in the trade have raised rates on frozen beef, pork, and poultry, French fries and potatoes, fruits and vegetables, juice concentrates, and other refrigerated cargoes beginning January 1, then again February 1, and continuing throughout the year. The lines are expected to implement increases across the board or on an individual basis with amounts and effective dates varying according to commodity, origin, or destination, seasonal shipping cycles, service requirements, and other factors.

“Carriers are attempting to recover mounting losses, a large portion of which resulted from the Asian economic crisis several years ago. The ripple effect of such a catastrophe—falling exchange rates, reduced lending, contraction of the consumer markets, stifling of consumer confidence—hit the US export market hard as demand went through the floor.

“Meanwhile, the relatively strong U.S. economy and falling Asian exchange rates has created a 20 percent surge in eastbound traffic with another double-digit surge predicted for the coming six months. This has created a great deal of demand for containers in Asia but much less so in the United States. Carriers have to get containers back to Asia somehow. They are looking to fill back hauls with very little demand.

“Reefer operators are especially vulnerable because there is very little inbound refrigerated traffic. These lines have been forced to offer discounts westbound. Rates are down across the board. They have fallen to as little as $2,000 per box and less. That is half the rate that existed twelve months earlier for some of the most expensive equipment in the industry.

“But lines report that recent demand has exceeded supply in certain areas for reefer equipment. This specialized equipment now ranges in price from $25,000 to $35,000 per forty-foot box, plus an equivalent amount in repair and maintenance costs over the container’s useful life. There are also costs of energy to power the equipment and personnel costs monitoring temperature. Pacific carriers incur further round trip costs because they often are forced to fill their expensive, but less space efficient, equipment at lower rates for nonreefer cargo. Shippers say they are expecting some form of westbound rate increase to hold.”

You have just been hired as the westbound logistics manager for the Great Bite Peach Company, headquartered in Michigan. The CEO invites you to an early Friday afternoon meeting with senior executives of the company including the chief financial officer, the VP of production, and the VP of Sales and Marketing, Ern Hewill, who is excited about the possibility of opening a vast new market in China. One of your current “A” clients, a major American retailer, is opening a chain of super markets across China and will buy all the fresh peaches you can produce. Upon further questioning, Hewill forecasts 5,000 to 6,000 container loads a year. The VP of production advises there will be no problem meeting the demand. “That’s fantastic,” says the CEO.

Hewill looks across the table at you. “It’s all up to you now,” he says. “I must provide a landed cost to our customer as soon as possible, no later than next Wednesday, or they go elsewhere. You get back to your office, call in your freight forwarder and find us a rate.”

It’s later in the afternoon now in an office overlooking the Seattle waterfront. The sales VP of Pacific Dreams Containership Company has just received a call from Great Bite Peach Company, who has been a customer from time to time. They said that they have the opportunity to sell a great deal of fresh peaches to a major retailer opening a chain of supermarkets across China and need to negotiate an agreement immediately in order to submit to a proposal to their customer.

The sales VP arranges a quick meeting with the CEO, Bob Hannus, and the owner’s representative. The owner’s rep is delighted. “We need this business. Friday’s ship has been going out light every week. We have only been operating at 60 percent of capacity westbound for months.”

Hannus isn’t as animated. He says: “This is reefer cargo. For us to carry this I may have to go out and buy or lease refrigerated equipment. Do you know what that costs?”

The owner’s rep says: “We can use the containers on the eastbound with department store merchandise. There is plenty of that.”

Hannus looks at his sales VP and says: “Make a deal we can both live with, hot shot. Oh, and by the way, don’t come back empty handed.”

*   **SCM Context - Shipper-Carrier Negotiation:** It presents a realistic SCM scenario involving a shipper (Great Bite Peach Company) and a container shipping line (Pacific Dreams) negotiating a contract for westbound (US to Asia) reefer cargo. This negotiation context highlights the *business and contractual aspects* of international shipping, which are crucial for understanding documentation needs.
*   **Reefer Cargo Complexity:** The focus on *reefer cargo* (refrigerated peaches) adds a layer of complexity, as reefer shipments often have *specific documentation requirements* related to temperature control, perishability, and potentially sanitary certificates. This complexity makes the case more realistic and challenging.
*   **Eastbound-Westbound Trade Imbalance:** The case highlights the real-world issue of *trade imbalances* (strong eastbound traffic, weak westbound traffic) in trans-Pacific trades and its impact on freight rates and container repositioning costs. This adds economic realism and complexity to the scenario.
*   **Negotiation and Contractual Aspects:** The case explicitly involves *negotiation* between shipper and carrier to reach a mutually agreeable contract. This highlights the *contractual nature* of international shipping and the importance of clear terms and conditions, which are often defined in shipping documents like the Bill of Lading and service contracts.
*   **Multiple Stakeholder Perspectives:** The case presents the situation from *both the shipper's (Great Bite Peach Company) and the carrier's (Pacific Dreams)* perspectives, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the challenges and priorities of different actors in the logistics chain.
*   **Open-Ended Questions - Problem-Solving Focus:** The accompanying questions are excellent for prompting *problem-solving* and *analytical thinking* related to logistics and contract negotiation. While not directly documentation-focused, they encourage consideration of various factors that *indirectly influence documentation needs* (cost, service quality, regulations, contractual terms).

**How to Leverage "The Great Bite Peach Company" Case Study for Your Project:**

This case study, along with its accompanying questions, is incredibly versatile and can be leveraged in several ways for your SCM Document Checklist Assistant project:

1.  **Inspiration for SCM Scenario Generation (Dataset 1 & 2):** This case study provides excellent inspiration for creating new SCM scenarios for both your Datasets 1 and 2:
    *   **Adapt the Scenario for Checklist Generation Task:** You can *adapt the "Great Bite Peach Company" scenario* to create a checklist generation task for your LLM assistant. For example, you can create a user query like: "I am the westbound logistics manager for Great Bite Peach Company. We are negotiating a contract to ship fresh peaches to China (CIF Shanghai) using Pacific Dreams Containership Company. What Port Arrival Document Checklist do I need to prepare to provide to our customer (the Chinese retailer) as part of our proposal, considering we are shipping reefer containers and need to negotiate freight rates?" The LLM assistant would then need to generate a Port Arrival Document Checklist tailored to this specific scenario (Reefer cargo, China destination, CIF Incoterms, Sea transport).
    *   **Create Evaluation Scenarios Based on Case Questions:** You can directly use the *case study questions* (1-7) as inspiration for designing *evaluation tasks* to test your LLM assistant's SCM problem-solving abilities. For example, you can ask the LLM assistant: "You are the westbound logistics manager for Great Bite Peach Company. Based on the 'Great Bite Peach Company' case study, what are the key issues you need to consider when negotiating a contract with Pacific Dreams Containership Company for shipping fresh peaches to China?" This tests the LLM's ability to analyze a complex SCM scenario and identify relevant issues (even if not directly documentation-focused).
    *   **Develop "Reasoning Examples" based on Case Analysis:** You can use the case study to create "reasoning examples" for your LLM assistant to learn from. For example, you can manually create a step-by-step "reasoning process" for answering Question 1 ("What are the issues as you see them?") from the perspective of the Great Bite Peach Company logistics manager, demonstrating how to analyze the scenario, identify key issues (cost, reefer equipment, westbound rates, eastbound traffic, customer needs), and structure a logical response.

2.  **Enrich LLM Assistant's Knowledge Base (Contextual Understanding):** The case study and its context provide valuable *real-world context* that can enrich your LLM assistant's knowledge base. You can train the LLM assistant on:
    *   **Understanding Reefer Cargo Specifics:** The challenges and costs associated with reefer containers.
    *   **Trans-Pacific Trade Dynamics:** The issue of eastbound-westbound trade imbalances and their impact on freight rates.
    *   **Importance of Contract Negotiation in Shipping:** The role of negotiation and service contracts in international shipping agreements.
    *   **Key Stakeholders in Shipping Negotiations:** Shippers, Carriers, Logistics Managers, Sales VPs, CEOs, Owner's Representatives – and their different perspectives and priorities in contract negotiations.

3.  **Inspiration for More Complex and Business-Oriented Scenarios:** This case study demonstrates how to create more *complex and business-oriented* SCM scenarios that go beyond simple checklist generation. It inspires you to design scenarios that:
    *   Involve *multiple stakeholders* and their different perspectives.
    *   Incorporate *economic and business considerations* (costs, profits, market dynamics, competition).
    *   Present *realistic business problems* and *decision-making challenges* that logistics professionals face in the real world.


## Case Study: The Great Bite Peach Company - Detailed Analysis & Brainstorming

**I. Scenario Summary:**

*   **Shipper:** Great Bite Peach Company (Michigan, USA), a fruit producer, seeking to expand into the Chinese market.
*   **Commodity:** Fresh Peaches (Reefer Cargo - Refrigerated Containers).
*   **Destination:** China (Supermarket chain across China, delivery to Shanghai - CIF Shanghai Incoterms implied).
*   **Volume:** 5,000 to 6,000 container loads per year (substantial volume, potential for long-term contract).
*   **Urgency:** Need landed cost quote by next Wednesday (very tight deadline for proposal).
*   **Carrier:** Pacific Dreams Containership Company (Seattle-based), a container shipping line operating in trans-Pacific trades. Westbound vessels currently running below capacity (60% capacity westbound).
*   **Carrier Challenge:** Need to invest in or lease expensive reefer containers and incur operational costs for reefer cargo (power, maintenance, personnel). Eastbound traffic is strong, but westbound reefer traffic is weak and rates are low.

**II. Question 1: You are the westbound logistics manager for the Great Bite Peach Company and are about to attempt negotiating a contract. What are the issues as you see them?**

**Great Bite Peach Company (Shipper) Perspective - Issues:**

*   **Tight Deadline for Landed Cost:** Need to provide a landed cost to the Chinese retailer by next Wednesday – very short timeframe for logistics planning and negotiation.
*   **Unknown Landed Cost Components:** Currently lack a clear understanding of all logistics costs, especially westbound ocean freight for reefer containers. Need to quickly determine ocean freight rates, surcharges, destination charges, port handling fees, insurance, potential customs duties/taxes in China, and documentation costs.
*   **Negotiating Favorable Freight Rates:** Need to negotiate competitive freight rates with Pacific Dreams to make their landed cost attractive to the Chinese retailer and ensure profitability. Westbound reefer rates are currently low, but carriers are seeking rate increases.
*   **Reefer Cargo Specifics & Costs:** Shipping fresh peaches requires specialized reefer containers, which are more expensive. Need to understand the reefer container surcharges, power costs, and any special handling fees for reefer cargo.
*   **Service Reliability & Transit Time:** Need to ensure reliable and timely delivery to China to maintain the freshness and quality of perishable peaches. Transit time and schedule reliability are critical service quality factors.
*   **Long-Term Contract Potential & Volume Commitment:** Potential for a large, long-term contract (5,000-6,000 containers/year) is attractive, but need to balance volume commitment with securing favorable and sustainable freight rates.
*   **Incoterms (CIF Shanghai Implied):** CIF Incoterms (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) imply that Great Bite Peach Company is responsible for arranging and paying for ocean freight and insurance to Shanghai. This responsibility necessitates securing ocean freight quotes and incorporating these costs into the landed cost calculation.

**III. Question 2: (Continuation of question one.) What other information do you need?**

**Great Bite Peach Company (Shipper) Perspective - Information Needs:**

*   **Ocean Freight Rates (Reefer Containers - Westbound to Shanghai):** Need *urgent quotes* for westbound reefer container freight rates from Pacific Dreams Containership Company (and potentially compare with other carriers for negotiation leverage). Need to clarify:
    *   Base freight rate per container (20ft/40ft reefer).
    *   Reefer surcharges (power, handling).
    *   Fuel surcharges (BAF).
    *   Currency Adjustment Factor (CAF).
    *   Terminal Handling Charges (THC) at origin and destination ports.
    *   Documentation fees.
    *   Validity period of the quote (given the tight deadline).
*   **Transit Time and Sailing Schedule:** Need to confirm transit time from US West Coast port to Shanghai and sailing frequency to ensure timely delivery.
*   **Service Contract Terms:** Need to negotiate and clarify contract terms with Pacific Dreams, including:
    *   Freight rate validity period (for a long-term contract).
    *   Volume commitment requirements (and flexibility if demand fluctuates).
    *   Service level agreements (transit time guarantees, reliability).
    *   Liability and insurance clauses.
    *   Payment terms.
*   **Destination Charges at Shanghai:** Need to estimate destination charges at the Port of Shanghai (beyond THC), including:
    *   Port dues and taxes.
    *   Customs clearance fees (brokerage).
    *   Terminal handling charges at destination (if not included in ocean freight).
    *   Inland transportation costs from Shanghai port to the retailer's distribution centers in China (if within scope of their responsibility).
*   **Insurance Costs:** Need to get a quote for cargo insurance to cover potential risks during ocean transport (under CIF Incoterms responsibility).
*   **Chinese Customs Duties and Taxes:** Need to research potential import duties, VAT, and other taxes applicable to fresh peach imports into China to accurately calculate landed cost.
*   **Chinese Import Regulations & Documentation:** Need to understand Chinese import regulations and documentation requirements for fresh peaches (Phytosanitary Certificate, Certificate of Origin, Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Bill of Lading, Customs Declaration, etc.) to ensure compliance and avoid delays at customs in China.

**IV. Question 3: You are the sales VP of Pacific Dreams Containership Company and are about to attempt negotiating a contract. What are the issues as you see them?**

**Pacific Dreams Containership Company (Carrier) Perspective - Issues:**

*   **Low Westbound Capacity Utilization:** Westbound vessels are currently operating at only 60% capacity, indicating underutilized assets and potential revenue shortfall on westbound hauls. Need to increase westbound cargo volume to improve profitability.
*   **Reefer Container Investment & Costs:** Carrying reefer cargo requires significant investment in expensive reefer containers ($25,000-$35,000 per box) and incurs ongoing operational costs (repair, maintenance, energy, personnel for monitoring temperature). Need to ensure freight rates cover these costs and provide a reasonable profit margin.
*   **Eastbound-Westbound Trade Imbalance & Container Repositioning:** Strong eastbound traffic creates demand for containers in Asia, but weak westbound traffic means containers need to be repositioned back to Asia, adding costs. Westbound reefer cargo is especially vulnerable as there is limited inbound reefer traffic to the US, making container repositioning even more critical and costly. Need to factor in container repositioning costs into westbound reefer freight rates.
*   **Market Pressure - Low Westbound Rates:** Westbound freight rates are currently low (as low as $2,000/box), driven by weak demand and competition. Need to balance the need to attract new business with the need to recover costs and improve profitability, especially for expensive reefer cargo.
*   **Potential for Long-Term Contract & High Volume:** Great Bite Peach Company offers the potential for a large, long-term contract (5,000-6,000 containers/year), which is attractive for filling westbound capacity and securing stable revenue. Need to structure a contract that is mutually beneficial and sustainable in the long run.
*   **Rate Increase Attempts & Market Acceptance:** Carriers are trying to implement rate increases (+$300/container), but market acceptance is uncertain due to new entrants and importer price sensitivity. Need to assess market conditions and determine if a rate increase for reefer cargo is feasible and competitive.
*   **Owner's Rep's Pressure for Business vs. CEO's Cost Concerns:** Sales VP is caught between the Owner's Rep's pressure to secure new business (fill capacity) and the CEO's concerns about costs and profitability of reefer cargo. Need to find a deal that satisfies both objectives.

**V. Question 4: (Continuation of question three.) What other information do you need?**

**Pacific Dreams Containership Company (Carrier) Perspective - Information Needs:**

*   **Great Bite Peach Company's Specific Requirements:** Need to clarify Great Bite Peach Company's specific service requirements and expectations:
    *   Desired freight rate level (target price range).
    *   Required service frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).
    *   Transit time requirements and schedule reliability expectations.
    *   Specific ports of loading (US West Coast) and discharge (Shanghai).
    *   Handling requirements for reefer cargo (temperature control, monitoring, etc.).
    *   Volume commitment (guaranteed minimum volume per year).
    *   Contract duration (long-term vs. short-term).
*   **Market Benchmarking - Competitor Rates:** Need to research competitor freight rates for westbound reefer cargo to Shanghai to ensure their offer is competitive while still profitable.
*   **Reefer Container Availability & Costs:** Need to assess the availability of reefer containers in their fleet and the costs associated with deploying them on this route (leasing costs, purchase costs, maintenance, repair, energy costs).
*   **Eastbound Rate Levels & Capacity Utilization:** Need to analyze current eastbound freight rates and capacity utilization to understand the revenue potential for the eastbound leg and how it can offset westbound reefer container repositioning costs.
*   **Fuel Costs & Surcharges Outlook:** Need to factor in current and projected fuel costs and consider appropriate fuel surcharges (BAF) to include in the freight rate quote.
*   **Contingency Planning - Risk Assessment:** Need to assess potential risks associated with this long-term contract (market fluctuations, regulatory changes, economic downturns) and consider incorporating contingency clauses into the service contract to mitigate these risks.

**VI. Question 5: How should the carrier explain to the shipper of Westbound cargo that the shipper is also expected to pay part of the cost of returning the empty or less lucratively loaded containers eastward to the U.S. West Coast?**

**Pacific Dreams Containership Company (Carrier) - Explanation Strategies:**

*   **Transparency and Cost Breakdown:** Be transparent with Great Bite Peach Company about the cost structure of reefer container shipping and clearly break down the freight rate components:
    *   Explicitly state the base freight rate for westbound transport.
    *   Clearly itemize reefer container surcharges (equipment surcharge, power surcharge, handling surcharge).
    *   Explain the concept of a "Container Imbalance Surcharge" or "Repositioning Fee" as a separate line item, rather than hiding it within the base rate.
    *   Provide data or industry benchmarks showing the typical cost premium for reefer container transport compared to standard dry containers.
*   **Educate Shipper on Trade Imbalance Economics:** Explain the fundamental economic reality of the trans-Pacific trade imbalance:
    *   Strong eastbound demand and high rates, but weak westbound demand and low rates.
    *   Necessity for carriers to reposition empty containers back to Asia to meet eastbound demand.
    *   Westbound shippers benefit from this repositioning flow, as carriers are willing to offer lower westbound rates to at least partially offset repositioning costs.
    *   However, even with lower westbound rates, some contribution from westbound shippers to repositioning costs is unavoidable for the carrier to operate sustainably.
*   **Highlight Value Proposition & Service Quality:** Emphasize the value proposition and service quality that Pacific Dreams offers to justify the freight rate:
    *   Reliable and frequent liner service to Shanghai.
    *   Expertise in handling perishable reefer cargo and maintaining temperature control.
    *   Commitment to on-time delivery and schedule reliability.
    *   Strong track record and reputation in trans-Pacific trades.
    *   Potential for long-term partnership and dedicated service for Great Bite Peach Company's growing China business.
*   **Negotiation & Compromise:** Frame the discussion as a *negotiation* and seek a *mutually agreeable* solution:
    *   Be willing to negotiate on the base freight rate and surcharges to some extent, while still ensuring cost recovery and a reasonable profit margin.
    *   Explore options for long-term contracts with rate stability and volume commitments in exchange for potentially more favorable rates.
    *   Offer value-added services (e.g., enhanced tracking, dedicated customer support) to justify the freight rate and build a strong relationship.
*   **Industry Benchmarks & Market Context:** Provide industry benchmarks or market data showing average reefer container freight rates for westbound trans-Pacific trades to demonstrate that their quote is competitive and in line with market realities.
