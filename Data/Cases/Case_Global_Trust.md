    *   **Segment Market by Commodity Type:** Segment the market by commodity types to identify the proportion of high-value, time-sensitive cargo within the overall trade flow.
*   **Assess Shipper Willingness-to-Pay for Faster Transit:**
    *   **Shipper Surveys & Interviews:** Conduct surveys and interviews with potential shippers (importers and exporters) on the US East Coast - Western Europe trade lane to assess their *willingness-to-pay a premium* for a 7-day transit time reduction compared to the standard 14-day transit.
    *   **Value of Time Analysis:** Conduct a "value of time" analysis for target cargo segments to quantify the *economic benefits* of faster transit times for shippers (reduced inventory holding costs, faster time-to-market, improved responsiveness, reduced stockouts, etc.). Estimate the potential premium shippers would be willing to pay based on these quantified benefits.
*   **Competitor Analysis - Existing Service Offerings & Pricing:**
    *   **Air Freight Rates (Benchmark):** Benchmark FastShip pricing against existing *air freight rates* on the US East Coast - Western Europe lane. FastShip, while faster than ocean, is still slower than air freight. The premium should be significantly lower than air freight to be attractive.
    *   **Existing Ocean Freight Rates (Baseline):** Analyze current ocean freight rates for standard container services on the US East Coast - Western Europe lane to establish a baseline for comparison.
    *   **Competition from Existing Ocean Carriers:** Assess competition from existing ocean carriers on this lane and their service offerings (transit times, reliability, value-added services). Determine if FastShip's 7-day transit time offers a *significant competitive advantage* over existing services.
*   **Operational Feasibility & Cost Structure of FastShip:**
    *   **FastShip Operating Costs:** Analyze the projected operating costs of the FastShip service, including fuel costs (higher speed = higher fuel consumption), port fees, terminal handling costs, crew costs, maintenance, and insurance.
    *   **Pricing Strategy & Profitability Analysis:** Develop a pricing strategy for FastShip that is competitive yet profitable, considering operating costs, market demand, competitor pricing, and shipper willingness-to-pay a premium.
