# CASE • Barbara’s Blouses

Barbara Linse buys blouses for a chain of ladies’ wear stores in major U.S. cities west of the Mississippi River. They sell clothing made in both the United States and Asia. Asia supplies an increasing amount and percentage of blouses that the chain sells. Twice yearly Barbara travels to Asia, mainly to Korea, Vietnam, and China. On each trip, she has the authority to place orders totaling up to 15,000 blouses. Prior to her trip, she and the chain’s other buyers agree on color themes they wish to promote; all items the chain’s buyers buy will be in the same, or harmonizing, patterns and colors. If individual buyers are uncertain, samples will be sent to the chain’s home office where Barbara’s boss makes the final decision. Barbara’s boss communicates with all buyers on a near-daily basis when they are on buying trips. Also, since nearly all the offshore buying is done in Asia, the individual buyers try to schedule their trips so they are in the same areas at about the same time.

## Questions for Barbara’s Blouses

1.  What are some of the risks of buying overseas that one can avoid by buying from domestic sources?

2.  Purchase contracts issued by Barbara’s firm provide for the goods to be produced, shipped, and received within five months of the date the contract is issued. Should the monetary amounts specified in the contract be in U.S. dollars or in the currency of the nation where the manufacturer is located? Why?

3.  Title to the goods can pass from seller to buyer at any point between the seller’s shipping dock and the buyer’s receiving dock. Which point should be used for the blouses Barbara’s firm is buying? Why?

4.  One of the concerns of U.S. retail chains is the possibility that goods they import have been made by child or prison labor. How can Barbara prevent this from happening with products that she buys for her chain?

5.  Barbara’s firm makes many purchases in Asia. How should they manage, or handle, the physical movement of the goods from Asia to their individual stores in the U.S.?

6.  The initial prices that potential sources in Asia quote to Barbara are for the blouses at their (the manufacturers’) shipping dock. What are all the additional costs between that point and the sales rack in one of the chain’s retail stores?

7.  You are Barbara’s boss. What criteria would you use to evaluate her work and the work of other buyers under your supervision?

## Case Study: Barbara's Blouses - Detailed Analysis & Brainstorming

**I. Scenario Summary:**

*   **Importer/Retailer:** Barbara Linse, a buyer for a chain of ladies' wear stores in major US cities west of the Mississippi River. "Barbara's Blouses" refers to the blouses she buys for this chain.
*   **Commodity:** Ladies' Blouses (Apparel).
*   **Sourcing Regions:** Asia (Korea, Vietnam, China - increasing percentage of blouses), United States (smaller percentage).
*   **Buying Trips:** Barbara travels to Asia twice yearly with authority to place orders up to 15,000 blouses per trip. Buyers coordinate trips for overlapping presence in Asia.
*   **Product Design & Themes:** Buyers agree on color themes and harmonizing patterns before trips. Home office (Barbara's boss) makes final decisions on samples if buyers are uncertain.
*   **Target Market:** Ladies' wear stores chain in US cities west of the Mississippi River.
*   **Supply Chain Flow (Asian Blouses - Current):** Direct shipment from Asian manufacturers (Korea, Vietnam, China) to US (implied - West Coast ports, given location of stores and mention of Asian origins).

**II. Question 1: What are some of the risks of buying overseas that one can avoid by buying from domestic sources?**

**Risks of Overseas Buying (Compared to Domestic Sourcing):**

*   **Longer Lead Times & Transit Times:** Overseas sourcing involves significantly longer lead times for production and transit times for shipping (weeks to months), compared to domestic sourcing with shorter lead times and transportation distances. This increases inventory holding costs, reduces responsiveness to market changes, and increases risk of delays.
*   **Higher Transportation Costs:** International shipping costs (ocean freight, air freight, inland transport) are significantly higher and more complex than domestic transportation costs. Fluctuations in fuel prices, currency exchange rates, and shipping capacity can further impact transportation costs.
*   **Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations:** Overseas sourcing involves currency exchange rate risks. Fluctuations in exchange rates between USD and Asian currencies can impact the final cost of goods and profitability.
*   **Cultural & Language Barriers:** Communication and coordination with overseas suppliers can be more challenging due to cultural and language differences, potentially leading to misunderstandings, errors, and delays in production and shipping.
*   **Quality Control & Distance:** Monitoring and ensuring quality control at distant overseas factories is more challenging and costly compared to domestic suppliers. Distance makes it harder to address quality issues quickly and directly.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions & Geopolitical Risks:** International supply chains are more vulnerable to disruptions from geopolitical events, natural disasters, port congestion, and global pandemics, which can impact production, transportation, and delivery timelines.
*   **Intellectual Property Risks:** Risk of intellectual property infringement or counterfeiting is potentially higher when sourcing from overseas, especially in regions with weaker IP protection.
*   **Ethical Sourcing & Labor Practices Concerns:** Ensuring ethical sourcing and compliance with labor standards (child labor, prison labor) is more challenging to monitor and enforce in distant overseas factories compared to domestic suppliers.
*   **Complexity of International Documentation & Customs:** International sourcing involves navigating complex customs procedures, tariffs, trade regulations, and documentation requirements, adding administrative burden and potential for delays and errors.

**Advantages of Domestic Sourcing (Avoiding Overseas Risks):**

*   **Shorter Lead Times & Faster Response:** Domestic sourcing offers significantly shorter lead times and faster response to changing market demands.
*   **Lower Transportation Costs & Simpler Logistics:** Domestic transportation is typically cheaper and less complex than international shipping.
*   **No Currency Exchange Rate Risk:** Transactions in USD eliminate currency exchange rate fluctuations.
*   **Easier Communication & Coordination:** Communication and coordination with domestic suppliers are generally easier due to shared language and culture.
*   **Better Quality Control & Oversight:** Easier and more cost-effective to monitor and ensure quality control at domestic factories.
*   **Reduced Supply Chain Disruption Risk:** Domestic supply chains are less vulnerable to international disruptions and geopolitical events.
*   **Stronger IP Protection:** Intellectual property is generally better protected within the same country.
*   **Easier Ethical Sourcing & Labor Monitoring:** Easier to monitor and ensure ethical sourcing and labor practices at domestic factories.
*   **Simpler Documentation & Customs:** Domestic sourcing avoids complex international documentation, customs procedures, and tariffs.

**III. Question 2: Purchase contracts issued by Barbara’s firm provide for the goods to be produced, shipped, and received within five months of the date the contract is issued. Should the monetary amounts specified in the contract be in U.S. dollars or in the currency of the nation where the manufacturer is located? Why?**

**Currency for Purchase Contracts - Recommendation: U.S. Dollars (USD)**

*   **Rationale for USD:**
    *   **Risk Mitigation for Importer (Manwell Toy Company):** Specifying prices in USD shifts the *currency exchange rate risk* to the *Asian manufacturers*. Manwell Toy Company's costs become more predictable and stable in their home currency (USD). This is particularly important for a company based in Canada and selling primarily in USD-dominated markets (even within Canada, USD is often used in international trade).
    *   **Simplified Budgeting & Financial Planning for Importer:** USD pricing simplifies budgeting, financial planning, and cost forecasting for Manwell Toy Company. They can more accurately predict their landed costs and profit margins in their reporting currency (likely CAD or USD).
    *   **Common Currency in International Trade (USD):** USD is a widely accepted and dominant currency in international trade, especially in global commodity markets and transactions involving US companies. Many Asian manufacturers are accustomed to quoting and transacting in USD.
    *   **Potential for Favorable Pricing (If USD Strengthens):** If the USD strengthens against Asian currencies during the contract period, Manwell Toy Company might benefit from lower effective costs in USD when paying in a weaker Asian currency.

*   **Considerations for Manufacturer Currency (Asian Currencies):**
    *   **Natural Hedge for Manufacturer (Local Costs):** Asian manufacturers might prefer to be paid in their local currencies (e.g., Korean Won, Vietnamese Dong, Chinese Yuan) as their production costs are primarily in these currencies. Pricing in local currency acts as a *natural hedge* against exchange rate fluctuations for the manufacturer.
    *   **Potential for Higher Prices (to Cover Manufacturer Risk):** If manufacturers are forced to quote in USD, they might build in a *risk premium* into their USD prices to compensate for potential losses due to adverse exchange rate movements. This could potentially lead to *higher prices for Manwell Toy Company* in the long run.
    *   **Negotiating Power & Market Dynamics:** The choice of currency can also depend on the *negotiating power* of each party and prevailing market practices in the toy industry and Asian sourcing regions. If it's common practice in the toy industry to quote in USD, or if Manwell Toy Company has strong negotiating leverage, they might be able to dictate USD pricing.

*   **Compromise - Dual Currency or Hedging (More Complex):**
    *   **Dual Currency Contracts:** In more complex scenarios, contracts could potentially be structured with *dual currencies* or *currency adjustment clauses* to share the exchange rate risk between buyer and seller. However, this adds complexity to contract negotiation and administration.
    *   **Hedging Strategies (by Manufacturer):** If manufacturers are paid in USD but prefer local currency, they can use *financial hedging instruments* (currency forwards, futures, options) to manage their currency exchange rate risk. However, this also adds complexity and costs for the manufacturer.

**VI. Question 3: Title to the goods can pass from seller to buyer at any point between the seller’s shipping dock and the buyer’s receiving dock. Which point should be used for the blouses Barbara’s firm is buying? Why?**

**Recommended Title Transfer Point: FOB (Free On Board) Origin - Asian Port (e.g., FOB Hong Kong/Singapore)**

*   **Rationale for FOB Origin (Seller's Shipping Dock):**
    *   **Simplified Logistics & Reduced Shipper Responsibility:** FOB Origin means that *title and risk of loss transfer to Manwell Toy Company (buyer) at the *origin port* (e.g., FOB Hong Kong or FOB Singapore) once the blouses are loaded on board the vessel at the Asian port. This simplifies logistics for the Asian manufacturers (sellers) as their responsibility ends at the origin port. They are only responsible for inland transport to the port and export clearance in their country.
    *   **Buyer Control over Shipping & Insurance (Potentially):** FOB Origin gives Manwell Toy Company (buyer) *control over the ocean freight and insurance arrangements* from the origin port onwards. They can choose their preferred carriers, negotiate freight rates, and select insurance coverage that best suits their needs and risk tolerance. This can potentially lead to cost savings and greater control over the inbound logistics process.
    *   **Alignment with CIF Destination Quote Request (Implied):** Since Manwell Toy Company is requesting a *landed cost* quote (CIF Shanghai in the Peach Company case, and similar need implied in this case), they are likely prepared to take responsibility for ocean freight and insurance. FOB Origin aligns well with this approach, as they will be responsible for these costs from the Asian port onwards.
    *   **Common Practice in International Trade (FOB):** FOB is a widely used and understood Incoterm in international trade, particularly for ocean shipments. It provides a clear and established point of title and risk transfer.

*   **Alternative Title Transfer Points & Considerations:**
    *   **EXW (Ex-Works) Origin (Manufacturer's Factory):** Title and risk transfer even earlier, at the manufacturer's factory. Manwell Toy Company would be responsible for *all* logistics from the factory gate onwards. This gives maximum control to the buyer but also increases their logistical burden and risk from the very beginning of the supply chain. Less common for apparel sourcing, might be considered for very large or sophisticated importers.
    *   **CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) Destination (e.g., CIF Vancouver/Halifax):** Title and risk transfer at the *destination port* in Canada. Asian manufacturers (sellers) would be responsible for arranging and paying for ocean freight and insurance to Canada. This shifts more logistical responsibility to the seller, which might be preferred by Manwell Toy Company for simplicity, especially initially. However, it reduces their control over shipping and insurance and might lead to less competitive freight rates (as manufacturers might build in a risk premium).
    *   **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) Destination (Manwell's Warehouse):** Title and risk transfer at Manwell Toy Company's *warehouse in Canada*. Asian manufacturers would be responsible for *all* logistics and costs all the way to the final destination warehouse, including import duties and taxes in Canada. This gives maximum simplicity to the buyer but also likely results in the highest prices, as manufacturers would need to manage all logistics complexities and risks and build these costs into their prices. Less common for large-volume apparel sourcing due to complexity and cost for manufacturers.

*   **Conclusion - FOB Origin Recommended for Balance:** FOB Origin (Asian Port) provides a good *balance* for Manwell Toy Company. It simplifies logistics for Asian manufacturers, gives Manwell control over shipping and insurance (potentially leading to cost savings), and is a common and well-understood Incoterm. While CIF Destination might be simpler initially, FOB Origin offers more control and potential long-term cost advantages for a company with established logistics capabilities.

**VII. Question 4: One of the concerns of U.S. retail chains is the possibility that goods they import have been made by child or prison labor. How can Barbara prevent this from happening with products that she buys for her chain?**

**Preventing Child or Prison Labor - Ethical Sourcing Strategies:**

*   **Supplier Code of Conduct & Certification:**
    *   **Establish a Strict Supplier Code of Conduct:** Develop a comprehensive code of conduct that explicitly prohibits child labor, prison labor, and other unethical labor practices. Make this code a mandatory part of all supplier contracts.
    *   **Require Supplier Certification & Compliance:** Require all Asian manufacturers to certify in writing their compliance with Manwell Toy Company's code of conduct and all applicable labor laws. Implement a formal supplier certification program that verifies ethical labor practices.
    *   **Independent Audits & Inspections:** Conduct *independent audits* and *unannounced inspections* of Asian factories by reputable third-party auditing firms specializing in social compliance and ethical sourcing. Focus on factories in higher-risk regions (China, Vietnam, etc.).

*   **Supply Chain Transparency & Traceability:**
    *   **Map the Supply Chain:** Map the entire supply chain, going beyond just the direct manufacturers to identify all tiers of suppliers (raw material providers, component manufacturers, subcontractors). This enhanced visibility is crucial for identifying potential risks deeper in the supply chain.
    *   **Traceability Systems:** Implement systems to track the origin of materials and components used in the toys to increase traceability and identify potential links to unethical labor practices further up the supply chain. Blockchain or other supply chain transparency technologies could be explored for enhanced traceability.

*   **Supplier Selection & Vetting Process:**
    *   **Rigorous Supplier Selection Criteria:** Incorporate ethical sourcing and labor compliance as *key criteria* in the supplier selection process, alongside price, quality, and reliability.
    *   **Supplier Vetting & Due Diligence:** Conduct thorough *vetting and due diligence* on potential Asian manufacturers *before* awarding contracts. This includes:
        *   Background checks on factories and owners.
        *   Review of factory certifications and labor compliance records.
        *   On-site factory visits and inspections (if feasible).
        *   Reference checks with other buyers or brands who have worked with these factories.

*   **Long-Term Supplier Relationships & Collaboration:**
    *   **Build Long-Term Partnerships:** Focus on building long-term, collaborative relationships with a smaller number of *reputable and ethical* Asian manufacturers who are committed to fair labor practices. Long-term relationships foster trust and transparency.
    *   **Supplier Training & Capacity Building:** Provide training and support to Asian manufacturers to help them improve their labor practices and comply with ethical sourcing standards. This collaborative approach is more effective than purely punitive measures.

*   **Contractual Clauses & Legal Safeguards:**
    *   **Include Strong Contractual Clauses:** Incorporate *explicit contractual clauses* in all supplier contracts that prohibit child labor, prison labor, and other unethical labor practices. Include clauses that allow for audits, inspections, and contract termination in case of violations.
    *   **Legal Review of Contracts:** Have all supplier contracts reviewed by legal counsel to ensure they provide adequate legal safeguards against ethical sourcing risks.

*   **Consumer Awareness & Brand Reputation:**
    *   **Communicate Ethical Sourcing Commitment to Consumers:** Publicly communicate Manwell Toy Company's commitment to ethical sourcing and its efforts to prevent child and prison labor in its supply chain. This builds brand trust and resonates with ethically conscious consumers.
    *   **"Ethical Sourcing" Labeling/Certification (Potentially):** Explore options for "ethical sourcing" labels or certifications to further demonstrate their commitment to consumers (if applicable and credible in the toy industry).

**VII. Question 5: Barbara’s firm makes many purchases in Asia. How should they manage, or handle, the physical movement of the goods from Asia to their individual stores in the U.S.?**

**Managing Physical Movement from Asia to US Stores - Logistics Strategy Options:**

*   **Current System (Vancouver & Winnipeg Warehouses - Refinement & Optimization):**
    *   **Maintain Centralized Warehousing:** Continue using Vancouver and Winnipeg warehouses as central distribution hubs for Western and Eastern Canada respectively.
    *   **Optimize Inbound Ocean Freight to Vancouver:** Focus on optimizing ocean freight from Asia to Vancouver (negotiate best rates, ensure reliable service, explore longer-term contracts).
    *   **Efficient Inland Transportation from Vancouver:** Improve efficiency of rail and trucking from Vancouver to Winnipeg and Western Canada stores. Explore intermodal options, optimize routes, consolidate shipments, and negotiate favorable rates with inland carriers.
    *   **Winnipeg Warehouse Optimization:** Optimize Winnipeg warehouse operations for efficient distribution to Eastern Canada stores (inventory management, order fulfillment, last-mile delivery).
    *   **Benefit:** Leverages existing infrastructure, established workflows, potentially lower ocean freight to West Coast ports, simpler inbound logistics.
    *   **Drawback:** Potentially longer transit times to Eastern Canada, higher inventory holding costs at central warehouses, less responsive to regional demand variations.

*   **Explore East Coast Port & Halifax Warehouse (New Option - Decentralization):**
    *   **Shift Some Inbound Flow to Halifax Port (East Coast):** Explore diverting a portion of Asian imports to the Port of Halifax (East Coast Canada), especially for toys destined for Eastern Canada stores.
    *   **Establish Halifax Warehouse (New):** Establish a new warehouse in or near Halifax to serve as a regional distribution hub for Eastern Canada stores.
    *   **Direct Shipments to Halifax (from Singapore):** Utilize Singapore as a consolidation point in Asia for shipments destined for Halifax, and explore ocean freight routes via Suez Canal to East Coast ports.
    *   **Benefit:** Potentially shorter transit times to Eastern Canada stores, lower inland transportation costs for Eastern Canada, potentially more responsive to Eastern Canada market demand.
    *   **Drawback:** Need to set up new warehouse infrastructure in Halifax, potentially higher ocean freight costs to East Coast ports (compared to West Coast), more complex inbound logistics with segmented flows to both Vancouver and Halifax.

*   **Direct Store Delivery (Potentially for High-Volume Outlets - Advanced & Complex):**
    *   **Direct Container Shipments to Major Retail Outlets:** For very high-volume retail stores, explore the feasibility of *direct container shipments* from Asian ports to inland ports or rail terminals closer to these major retail outlets, bypassing central warehouses entirely.
    *   **Requires Sophisticated Logistics & Coordination:** This option is much more complex and requires highly sophisticated logistics planning, real-time tracking, and tight coordination with carriers, customs, and inland transport providers. Might be considered for *very large, predictable* orders to key retail outlets, but likely not feasible for the majority of store deliveries.
    *   **Benefit:** Potentially fastest transit times to key outlets, minimized warehousing costs, highly responsive to store-level demand.
    *   **Drawback:** Highest logistical complexity, requires very accurate demand forecasting and order planning, less flexibility, potentially higher per-unit transportation costs if not fully optimized, complex documentation and customs clearance for direct store deliveries.

*   **Hybrid Approach (Most Realistic & Flexible):**
    *   **Maintain Vancouver & Winnipeg Warehouses for Core Distribution:** Continue using Vancouver and Winnipeg warehouses for the majority of store replenishment and inventory management.
    *   **Pilot East Coast/Halifax Option for Eastern Canada:** *Pilot* the East Coast/Halifax option for a *portion* of the toy volume destined for Eastern Canada stores to test its feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Start with a limited volume and gradually scale up if successful.
    *   **Consider Direct Store Delivery (Selectively - Future):** Explore direct store delivery options *selectively* for a *small number* of very high-volume retail outlets in the future, after optimizing the core warehousing and distribution network.
    *   **Benefit:** Combines the benefits of centralized warehousing (efficiency, economies of scale for core distribution) with the potential advantages of decentralization (faster transit times to Eastern Canada, responsiveness to regional demand). Allows for a phased and data-driven approach to optimizing the logistics network.
