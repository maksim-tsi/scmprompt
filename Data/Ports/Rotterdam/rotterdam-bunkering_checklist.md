# Port of Rotterdam - Bunkering Checklists (Based on IAPH & Port Context)

**Document Source:** World Ports Sustainability Program (WPSP) - IAPH Clean Marine Fuels Bunkering Checklists & Rotterdam Port By-Laws 2020 Context

**Focus:** Bunkering Checklists for Liquefied Gas (LNG, LBG, LH2) Bunkering in Port of Rotterdam

**Note:** *This document summarizes information related to bunkering checklists in Port of Rotterdam, drawing from the World Ports Sustainability Program (IAPH) and the context of Rotterdam Port By-Laws. It focuses on checklists for Liquefied Gas bunkering (LNG, LBG, LH2).*

## Bunkering Checklists in Port of Rotterdam - Overview

*   **Harmonized Bunker Checklists:** Port of Rotterdam, like other ports within the World Ports Sustainability Program, utilizes harmonized bunker checklists. These checklists, developed by the IAPH Clean Marine Fuels working group, are designed to ensure a high level of quality and responsibility for bunker operators, especially for alternative marine fuels.
*   **Purpose of Checklists:** To reflect the *extra requirements of ports* regarding bunker operations of alternative marine fuels in or near their port environment and to promote *harmonization* across ports, reducing confusion for vessels bunkering in multiple locations.
*   **Focus on Liquefied Gases:**  The checklists specifically address bunkering scenarios involving liquefied gases as marine fuels, such as LNG, LBG (Liquefied Biogas), and Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).

## Ship-to-Ship (STS) Bunkering Checklist - Port of Rotterdam Context

*   **IAPH Ship-to-Ship Bunker Checklist (LNG, LBG, LH2):** Port of Rotterdam likely utilizes a version of the IAPH Liquefied Gas bunker checklist for Ship-to-Ship bunkering.
*   **Two Versions Available (A & B):** The IAPH provides two versions, and Port of Rotterdam (or individual terminals within Rotterdam) likely chooses one based on responsibility allocation:
    *   **Version A (Project-Based Bunkering):**  For project-based bunkering alongside a quay, where the *site operator (terminal)* is *fully engaged and shares responsibility* for STS bunkering safety.  Suitable when the terminal takes a more active role in overseeing the bunkering operation.
    *   **Version B (Bunker Ready Terminal):** For bunkering vessels alongside a "Bunker Ready Terminal," where the *receiving vessel* has overall control and the *terminal is primarily informed* of risk mitigation measures. Suitable when the terminal's role is more focused on providing a safe berth and less on direct operational control of the bunkering process itself.
*   **Recommendation:** IAPH recommends terminals be involved to ensure safe bunker operations. Port of Rotterdam likely *involves terminals* in LNG bunkering safety, potentially using Version A or requiring terminal involvement even with Version B.
*   **Checklist as a Safety Tool:** The LNG STS bunker checklist is an *operational safety tool*. Port authorities (like Rotterdam) and terminal operators are expected to be involved at a *system safety level* to ensure safe LNG bunkering, beyond just the operational checklist.

**LNG Bunker Checklist Ship to Ship (Version A/B - Generic Structure):**

*(The following is based on the structure of the example "LNG Bunker Checklist - Ship to Ship - Version 3.7A - June 2019" you provided. The specific content may vary slightly in Port Rotterdam's implementation, but the overall structure is likely similar)*
