        *   **Specific Conditions for Rinse Water Discharge during Pressure Tests:**
            *   COD and suspended solids values may exceed limits if justified by dock water analysis (values increased proportionally to intake dock water values).
            *   Last 25% of tank discharge *only during daylight*. If last 25% pumped to collection tank(s), entire contents of collection tank(s) discharged *only during daylight*.
            *   Port Authority Supervisor (contact number provided) *must always be notified in timely manner* for inspection possibility.
