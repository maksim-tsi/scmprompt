**Document Source:** [Provided Document - "Port Instructions of Antwerp Port"]
**Effective Date:** December 2024 (Assumed from document footer)

**Note:** *Analysis focuses on Chapter 10 Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods from the Port Instructions of Antwerp Port, extracting key regulations, procedures, checklists, and specific requirements.*



## 10. HANDLING AND STORAGE OF HAZARDOUS GOODS (Chapter 10 of Port Instructions) - Standalone Comprehensive Summary:

*   **10.1. General:**

    *   **10.1.2. Required documentation:** For transit storage facilities handling hazardous goods: One of SDS, BIG, ERICARDS, KNAP documents must be available for Harbour Master's Office submission on request. Other storage facilities: SDS *must* be available for all hazardous substances. **(Checklist Item: Hazardous Goods Storage - SDS/BIG/ERICARDS/KNAP Availability)**

    *   **10.1.3. Declaration of hazardous and/or polluting goods:**
        *   **Definition of declarant:** "Forwarder" defined as party responsible for pre-carriage (road/rail/inland waterway), including inland waterway ship responsible party. "Shipping agent" is local party responsible for seagoing vessel. Collaboration agreements between agents possible for declarations, but responsibility for fire watch, security, quantity restrictions remains with *shipping agent*. If no forwarder designated for loading/unloading hazardous goods by land/inland waterway, *shipping agent* takes declaration responsibility. "Authorised representative" or "contact person" names specified in declaration - "DGN Contact" or contact person can be additionally specified for immediate follow-up.
        *   **Declarations for pre-carriage, unloading, pumping over, transfer and keeping aboard:** Declarations to Harbour Master's Office via APICS desk or EDI (registration via C-point mandatory for both). APICS code assigned upon registration. Contact names in declarations must match registered DGN contact of declarant.
            *   **Using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange):** Declarants identified by DUNS number in EDI messages. Notification type: IFTDGN (International Forwarding and Transport Dangerous Goods Notification) sent by declarant to Harbour Master's Office (third party submission possible with prior written agreement to Harbour Master's Office). Cancelling declaration via IFTDGN with "cancellation" purpose (deletes entire declaration). APERAK message from Harbour Master's Office in response to IFTDGN (Acceptance, Request to correct errors (rectification required electronically by declarant, until corrected processing/safety file inclusion not possible), Rejection (duty to declare not fulfilled, "protocol error" messages)).
            *   **Using the APICS desk:** Content requirements same as EDI. "Rejection" errors in EDI also prevent saving/sending from APICS desk.
            *   **Principles relating to electronic declarations (EDI & APICS desk):** Notification *required* for all hazardous/contaminating goods arriving at front quay transit storage or remaining onboard ship in port. Each notification references a 2nd party responsible for on-carriage. Reporting obligation for dangerous/contaminated bulk goods (loading/unloading ship-ship, keeping onboard, no gas-free certificate for empty tanks). Electronic declarations comprise 3 levels: Header (once per declaration), Consignment/CNI (1-999 times), Goods details (GID) (1-99 times per consignment).
            *   **Data elements in declarations:**
                *   **Capacity of the declarant (Header):** IFTDGN message includes capacity: DA (declaring agent), DF (declaring forwarder), CG (agent, not declarant), FW (forwarder, not declarant). Declarant is DA or DF. Declarant name, full address, reference, telephone, authorized representative name, and optional "DGN Contact" details (for follow-up) specified.
                *   **The term “principal mode of transport”:** EDI: Main transport mode in header, other modes at consignment level. APICS desk: Pre-carriage mode at header, on-carriage mode at consignment level. Main transport mode (EDI): Ship if involved in transport chain. Inland navigation craft if no ship involved. If two equivalent transport modes, unloading mode is main. Example scenarios provided for main transport mode determination.
                *   **1 declaration = 1 type of goods (bulk/packed) = 1 handling = 1 means of supply but = several means of on-carriage = multiple locations (terminals).** Multiple quays per handling possible in one declaration (e.g., unloading hazardous goods from seagoing vessel at multiple terminals).
                *   **Derogation requests (Port Regulations quantity restrictions etc.) submitted via APICS desk *before handling*. "Extended stay" requests for directly handled goods submitted based on declaration for terminal delivery.**
                *   **Limited details as "TBN (To be nominated)" allowed in declarations (ENI number, stay number, on-carriage party name, container number etc.)**, correct details communicated to Harbour Master's Office *prior to handling, no later than handling day*, by amending electronic declaration.
                *   **Identification of means of transport in declarations:** Seagoing vessels (declarations for ships entering port with hazardous goods or keeping onboard - declarant capacity AGENT (DA), Ship IMO number, Stay number, ETA, ETD required). Seagoing vessels departing with hazardous goods (declarant capacity FORWARDER (DF) or AGENT (DA) for transshipment, Ship IMO number, Stay number or 'TBN' required). Inland navigation craft (ENI number and name or 'TBN' required).
                *   **Goods-related elements to be specified (Level III):** Packaged hazardous goods (IMDG Code applies - Code regulations: IMD, Technical designation "proper shipping name" + "technical name" optionally, Danger class (IMDG class + subdivision + UN-number, calibre for specific Class 1 UN numbers), Secondary dangers (IMDG classes), Flash point (°C/°F) for Class 3 goods, Packaging group, Outer packaging type/number, inner packaging type/number (if known), Net weight (kg/tonnes, NEQ weight for Class 1 explosives), Container/trailer loading (Y/N, container/trailer number required for all containerized goods), On-board stowage location (for ships entering/keeping cargo), Transport authorization number (consignment level - Level II), Class 7 goods additional info (per consignment - Sender, Recipient, Transport provider approval numbers; per goods consignment - Activity, Transport index, Criticality index, Isotope, UN group). Bulk goods from IBC Code section 17 (liquid chemicals - Code regulations: IBC, Official/technical transport name, UN number, MARPOL category, Pollution/Safety Hazard indication, Outer packaging type (bulk code), Packaging number (0), Onboard location (tank number), Net weight). Goods from IGC Code section 19 (gas in tankers - Code regulations: IGC, Official/technical transport name, UN number, Class, Outer packaging type (bulk code), Packaging number (0), Onboard location (tank number), Net weight).

            *   **Handling date principles:** Date of Operation (DOA) = handling time of principal transport mode. Time of handling for secondary transport mode = Date of Arrival or Date of Departure (depending on goods handling relative to main transport mode). Examples provided for Agent (pre-carriage sea, on-carriage truck) and Forwarder (pre-carriage truck, on-carriage sea) scenarios.
            *   **Locations:** 2 location types in declaration: Handling location (mandatory - terminal code), 2nd location (optional - warehouse/terminal code for pre-carriage/on-carriage via warehouse/terminal). For export - 2nd location = most recent temporary storage warehouse in port before quay of shipment.
