Submitted *after pre-notification*, *no later than 24 hours before ETA Pilot vessel or ETA Entry Point* (transit vessels). **Information specified in First Berth Request (relevant for Container Shipping):** ETA Entry point, Berth, Entry point, ETD, Mooring side, Operational fore/aft draught (m), Origin/Destination, Crew, Previous/Next port, Contact person details, ETD Previous port, ETA Next port, Arrival type (ETA, GTO, GTA, BTV). Comments section for: "dead or unmaneuverable ship," mooring alongside another vessel, own lines recourse, Deruganck dock mooring side deviation/expected departure draft.
            *   **Specification of arrival (Container Focus):** Submitted *after berth request approval*. **Information to be sent:** Pilotage order, Bow/stern thruster operational status, Arrival type (updated GTO/GTA), Preferred river tugboat company, Dock services ordering (optional).
            *   **Specification of mooring side (Container Focus):** Shipping agent *must specify mooring side* in berth request via APICS desk (Port, Starboard, Tide dependent, On board, No preference, Bow and Stern - requires Port Authority approval). Changes to mooring side procedure outlined.

        *   **Shifting (Container Terminals Focus):** General shifting definition. Request for berth shift for container vessels, notification procedure, specification of mooring side (as above).

        *   **Departure (Container Terminals Focus):** General Departure definition. Notification of departure procedure.

*   **8.4 Berths:**

    *   **8.4.1. Berth allocation:** HMO grants berth permission. Concessionaire/owner preferential berth use reported to HMO. Seagoing ship captain responsible for berth agreement with terminal operator. Berth allocation does not absolve captain's safety duty. Captains deeming berth unsafe notify HMO.

Storm procedure invoked by ACC during gale force winds (shipping agent responsibility to inform vessels, vessels must apply matrix measures). Customer responsible for damages caused by non-compliance. *Detailed mooring requirements, especially for storm conditions and Shore Tension at container terminals.*

    *   **8.4.7. Maximum mooring width:** Maximum mooring width determined by HMO per terminal. General max mooring width rules for vessels alongside quays, specific rules for Scheldt container terminals (inland craft max alongside seagoing, max mooring widths for Europa Terminal, North Sea Terminal), Deurganck Dock (max mooring widths for inland craft, seagoing vessels alongside at different Deurganck Dock quays). Bunker vessels/inland navigation craft alongside seagoing vessels only for strictly necessary operations.

Free moorings at river Scheldt container terminals (berth must be free upon arrival/shifting - specific rules for different terminals/docks and vessel movements). Free berth behind locks (berth must be free upon lock exit/leaving previous berth). Container crane procedures at container terminals on vessel arrival/departure (cranes peaked, no cranes obstructing mooring area). Main concessionaire/owner ensures safe boarding means. Stern-to quay mooring requires HMO authorization (daylight only, good visibility, favorable weather, time-limited to loading/unloading). Specific notification procedures for stern-to mooring. Vessel moored stern-to liable for infrastructure/third-party damage. *Detailed safe mooring practices, especially relevant to container terminals and specific mooring configurations.*

*   **8.5. Pilots:** (Focused breakdown on mandatory pilotage and exemptions, relevant to container vessels)

    *   **8.5.1. Mandatory use of pilotage services for seagoing vessels:** Pilot assistance mandatory in non-tidal port areas (exceptions: quay movements with permanent shore connection, dredgers). Mandatory pilotage especially for: Seagoing vessels using tugs, tankers with hazardous liquids/gases in bulk (loaded or emptied). Pilotage mandatory at all times if visibility < 1000m OR wind force ≥ 6 Beaufort (HMO assesses/communicates). Pilotage services at vessel's responsibility/expense, port users comply with HMO conditions. HMO may impose additional pilotage requirements based on vessel size/fairway (vessel's expense). HMO may permit other authorized/unauthorized pilots in case of authorized provider non-compliance or general interest compromise (limited to urgent situations).

    *   **8.5.2. Exemption from mandatory pilotage:** HMO may grant exemptions if HMO conditions met (derogation from 8.5.1). Exemption revocable for public safety. Conditions for exemption outlined for: Seagoing vessels < 120m length and 6m draught (navigator familiarity with port/regulations, Dutch/English knowledge); Seagoing vessels ≥ 120m length and 6m draught (additional conditions: navigator permanent crew, exemption application, route coverage history as navigator); Seagoing vessels suitable for estuarine navigation (similar conditions as larger vessels). Ships carrying hazardous cargo in bulk generally *cannot be exempted* from pilotage (exception for bunkering seagoing ships under specific conditions - detailed conditions for bunkering ships outlined, focusing on vessel size, equipment, crew qualifications, operational procedures).

*   **8.6. Towage:** (Focused breakdown on tug usage requirements, relevant to container vessels)

    *   **8.6.2. Request for the use of tugs:** Master *always* reports tug requests to authorized provider via HMO IT system/communication channel. Required information in tug request: Applicant identity/capacity, vessel nationality/name/dimensions/tonnage, requested tug number/towing force, special vessel/cargo nature, departure/shifting time (for departing/shifting vessels), berth/ETA entry point (for arriving vessels). Tug order lodging deadlines specified for different scenarios (single river section shifting, departing/shifting from behind locks, arriving from Lower Sea-Scheldt, arriving from Upper Scheldt). Towage operations start only after ACC confirmation.

    *   **8.6.3. Mandatory use of tugs:** Master responsible for determining tug necessity/number (good seamanship). Tug use *mandatory* for: Pontoons with tonnage certificate/width ≥ 16m. Dead/unmaneuverable ships (at least 2 tugs). Specific docks: Southern Inlet Dock (mandatory tug for all seagoing vessels; more tugs required based on vessel size/bow thruster status), Inlet Dock 1 (Jetty 625A - tug mandatory for all seagoing vessels), Bevrijdings Dock (vessels > 45m width - tug mandatory forward/backward), Bevrijdings Dock (vessels over 180m/250m - tugs required for swinging/astern movements, more tugs for larger vessels and higher wind force). HMO may require tugs for nautical safety, deviating from master's request.
