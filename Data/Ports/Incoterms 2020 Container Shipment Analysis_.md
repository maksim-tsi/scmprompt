# **Implications of Incoterms 2020 for International Container Shipments in Multimodal Transport**

**1\. Introduction: Understanding Incoterms 2020 and Multimodal Container Shipments**

Incoterms, short for International Commercial Terms, are a set of globally recognized rules that define the responsibilities and obligations of buyers and sellers in international trade contracts 1. These rules, published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), provide a standardized framework for understanding the division of costs, risks, and responsibilities associated with the delivery of goods in international transactions 4. It is important to recognize that Incoterms are not mandatory legal statutes enacted by governments; rather, they serve as guidelines that parties to a contract mutually agree upon before a shipment takes place 6. The ultimate determination of each party's responsibilities, as well as the allocation of costs and the assumption of risk, rests on the agreement reached between the buyer and the seller 6.

The increasing prevalence of containerized multimodal transport, which involves the movement of goods using a combination of transport modes such as road, rail, sea, and air, underscores the critical importance of correctly applying Incoterms 6. Containers facilitate the seamless transition of goods between these different modes of transport, making multimodal shipping an efficient and often necessary approach in global supply chains 7. The proper application of Incoterms in this context is essential to avoid potential misunderstandings and disputes between trading partners and to ensure the smooth and efficient transit of goods from origin to final destination 1. This report aims to provide a detailed analysis of each of the 11 Incoterms 2020 rules, specifically examining their implications for international container shipments within multimodal transport chains. The analysis will focus on the delineation of responsibilities, the allocation of costs across various stages of transport, and the management of risks assumed by both the buyer and the seller.

**2\. Detailed Analysis of Incoterms 2020 Rules for International Container Shipments:**

**Ex Works (EXW)**

While technically permissible for container shipments, the application of Ex Works (EXW) in international transactions involving containers is generally discouraged 9. Under EXW, the seller's primary obligation is to make the goods available to the buyer at a named place, typically the seller's premises 2. This arrangement places the maximum responsibility on the buyer, who assumes all costs and risks associated with taking the goods from the seller's location to their final destination 1. A significant challenge arises for the buyer in handling export formalities in the seller's country, which can be complex and may lead to complications 9. For instance, even if the buyer manages the export process, the seller might still be considered the exporter of record 9. The minimal responsibility of the seller under EXW extends to the loading of goods into the container; the buyer is responsible for arranging and executing this loading at the seller's premises, bearing all associated expenses and risks 9.

The allocation of costs under EXW reflects this division of responsibility. The seller's costs are limited to the value of the goods and their packaging 9. The buyer, on the other hand, is responsible for all costs associated with the international transport chain, including origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, insurance, destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, import duties and taxes, and any demurrage or detention charges incurred due to their delays 1. The risk of loss or damage to the goods also transfers to the buyer at the earliest stage, specifically when the goods are ready to be loaded onto the buyer's vehicle at the seller's premises 9. This early transfer of risk, even before the goods leave the seller's location, highlights the substantial risk assumed by the buyer under EXW 10. Due to the complexities involved in international export procedures for the buyer, EXW is generally more suitable for domestic trade rather than international container shipments 9.

**Free Carrier (FCA)**

Free Carrier (FCA) is a more versatile Incoterm suitable for all modes of transport, including multimodal shipments involving containers, and is often preferred over EXW for international container shipments 1. FCA offers greater flexibility by allowing delivery to various named places, which can be the seller's premises or another agreed-upon location such as a terminal 1. Importantly, FCA places the responsibility for export clearance on the seller, addressing a key challenge associated with EXW in international trade 1. The responsibility for loading goods into the container under FCA depends on the agreed delivery point. If delivery occurs at the seller's premises, the seller is responsible for loading the goods onto the buyer's collecting vehicle, which could be a truck transporting a container 7. However, if the delivery occurs at another agreed location, such as a port container terminal, the seller's obligation is fulfilled by delivering the goods to the carrier or the buyer's designated person, ready to be unloaded from the seller's transport 8. The buyer then typically handles the loading of the goods into the container at this location.

Under FCA, the seller's costs include the value of the goods, their packaging, and the cost of loading the goods onto the collecting vehicle if delivery takes place at the seller's premises 9. The seller also covers the expenses associated with export formalities 9. Transport costs beyond the FCA delivery point are the responsibility of the buyer 9. This means that depending on the agreed delivery location, the origin terminal handling charges might be borne by either the seller or the buyer. Costs such as loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, insurance, destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, import duties and taxes, and demurrage/detention (if incurred after risk transfer) are generally the buyer's responsibility. The risk of loss or damage to the goods under FCA transfers to the buyer at the agreed place and point when the seller hands over the goods to the carrier or the buyer's designated person 8. This could be at the seller's premises after loading or at another agreed location before unloading 8. A crucial aspect of FCA is clearly defining the agreed place and point of delivery in the contract to avoid potential misunderstandings regarding loading and unloading responsibilities 9.

**Free Alongside Ship (FAS)**

Free Alongside Ship (FAS) is an Incoterm specifically reserved for sea and inland waterway transport only and is not suitable for container shipments 1. FAS is designed for scenarios involving bulk cargo or non-containerized goods where the seller can directly place the goods alongside the vessel nominated by the buyer at the named port of shipment 1. Given this specific application, the concept of loading goods into a container by the seller is not applicable under FAS. Instead, the buyer assumes the responsibility for the contract of carriage, which includes the loading of the goods onto the ship from alongside the vessel at the port of shipment 12.

Under FAS, the seller is responsible for all costs incurred until the goods have been placed alongside the vessel at the port of shipment 12. This includes costs related to checking, packaging, marking, and export clearance 12. From the moment the goods are alongside the ship, the buyer bears all subsequent costs, including loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, insurance, destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, import duties and taxes, and any demurrage or detention charges incurred after the risk transfer 12. The risk of loss or damage to the goods under FAS transfers from the seller to the buyer when the goods have been placed alongside the vessel nominated by the buyer at the loading point at the named port of shipment 12. A potential challenge for the seller arises if the vessel is delayed or does not arrive as scheduled, as the seller retains the risk until the goods are alongside the vessel 12. Furthermore, the buyer needs to ensure the vessel has the capability and equipment to load the goods from the quay or barge, as the loading process is at the buyer's risk and cost 12.

**Free on Board (FOB)**

Similar to FAS, Free on Board (FOB) is an Incoterm specifically intended for sea and inland waterway transport and is generally not recommended for containerized goods 1. FOB is most suitable for bulk cargo or non-containerized goods where the loading of the goods onto the vessel at the named port of shipment can be clearly defined 1. Under FOB, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on board the vessel nominated by the buyer at the named port of shipment 1. For container transport, the point of loading is considered to be when the container is lifted onto the vessel and the lifting cables become slack 15.

The seller's cost responsibilities under FOB include all costs up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel at the named port of shipment 15. This typically includes origin terminal handling charges and the costs associated with loading the goods onto the vessel 17. Once the goods are on board the vessel, the buyer assumes responsibility for all subsequent costs, including ocean freight, insurance, destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, import duties and taxes, and any demurrage or detention charges incurred after this point 15. The risk of loss or damage to the goods under FOB transfers from the seller to the buyer when the goods are loaded on board the vessel at the named port of shipment 1. A significant challenge arises from the fact that most containerized goods are now delivered to container yards rather than directly loaded onto a specific vessel, making FOB less suitable for this common shipping practice 15. Using FOB for container shipments can create ambiguity about when the risk and responsibility transfer, potentially leading to disputes 15. For container transport, Incoterms like Free Carrier (FCA) are generally more appropriate 8.

**Carriage Paid To (CPT)**

Carriage Paid To (CPT) is an Incoterm that can be used for any mode of transport, including containerized and multimodal shipments 1. Under CPT, the seller contracts and pays for the carriage of the goods to the named place of destination 7. The seller is responsible for arranging the loading of the goods onto the first carrier, which could be a truck transporting a container to the port 19.

The seller's cost responsibilities under CPT include origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel charges, ocean freight, and destination terminal handling charges, as the seller pays for the carriage to the named place of destination 19. However, the buyer is typically responsible for the cost of unloading the goods at the destination, unless otherwise agreed in the contract 20. The buyer also bears the costs of inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, import duties and taxes 19. Importantly, under CPT, the seller is not obligated to provide insurance, so the buyer usually assumes this responsibility 19. The risk of loss or damage to the goods under CPT transfers from the seller to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the first carrier at the agreed place 7. This early risk transfer, before the main sea voyage, is a key characteristic of CPT and can be a point of consideration for buyers of containerized goods who might prefer the risk to transfer at a later stage 21. A common point of confusion with CPT is the distinction between the place of delivery (where risk transfers to the first carrier) and the named place of destination (to which the seller pays for carriage) 20.

**Carriage and Insurance Paid To (CIP)**

Carriage and Insurance Paid To (CIP) is another Incoterm suitable for all modes of transport, including multimodal container shipments 1. CIP is similar to CPT, with the crucial addition that the seller is obligated to obtain insurance coverage for the buyer's benefit for the risk of loss or damage to the goods during carriage to the named place of destination 7. The seller is responsible for arranging the loading of the goods onto the first carrier, similar to CPT 22. The insurance coverage obtained by the seller under CIP should be at least 110% of the value of the goods 4.

The allocation of costs under CIP largely mirrors that of CPT, with the seller responsible for origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, and destination terminal handling charges 22. Additionally, the seller bears the cost of the mandatory insurance coverage 22. The buyer is typically responsible for the cost of unloading the goods at the destination, unless agreed otherwise, as well as inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, and import duties and taxes 22. The risk of loss or damage to the goods under CIP transfers from the seller to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the first carrier at the agreed place, the same as in CPT 22. Therefore, despite the seller providing insurance, the risk still transfers early in the journey 22. Buyers using CIP should ensure that the seller obtains adequate insurance coverage that meets their specific needs 22. Incoterms 2020 clarifies that CIP requires a higher level of insurance coverage (Institute Cargo Clauses (A) or similar) compared to CIF (Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), reflecting the broader applicability of CIP across various modes of transport 1.

**Cost and Freight (CFR)**

Cost and Freight (CFR) is an Incoterm specifically for sea and inland waterway transport and is generally not recommended for container shipments 1. CFR requires the seller to pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination 27. The seller is responsible for loading the goods on board the vessel at the port of shipment 27.

Under CFR, the seller bears the costs of origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel, and ocean freight to the named port of destination 28. The buyer, however, is responsible for the costs of destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, and import duties and taxes 28. The seller is not obligated to provide insurance under CFR, so this remains the buyer's responsibility 28. The risk of loss or damage to the goods under CFR transfers from the seller to the buyer as soon as the goods are loaded on board the vessel at the port of export 27. This early risk transfer, while the seller continues to pay for the freight to the destination port, can be a point of confusion 27. Given that CFR's risk transfer point at loading onto the vessel does not align well with the typical container terminal handling process, CPT is generally considered a better alternative for containerized cargo 27.

**Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)**

Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) is another Incoterm specifically for sea and inland waterway transport and can be applied to containerized shipments 1. CIF is similar to CFR, with the added requirement that the seller must obtain minimum insurance coverage against the buyer's risk of loss or damage to the goods during the sea voyage to the named port of destination 4. The seller is responsible for loading the goods on board the vessel at the port of shipment 4. The insurance coverage obtained by the seller under CIF should be at least 110% of the value of the goods 4.

Under CIF, the seller bears the costs of origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, and the mandatory minimum insurance to the named port of destination 4. The buyer is responsible for destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, inland haulage at the destination, import customs clearance, and import duties and taxes 4. Similar to CFR, the risk of loss or damage to the goods under CIF transfers from the seller to the buyer as soon as the goods are loaded upon the vessel at the port of shipment 4. This early risk transfer, even though the seller provides minimum insurance, means the buyer still bears the risk during the main sea voyage and would need to rely on the insurance in case of damage 4. While CIF can be used for container shipments, Incoterms like CPT or CIP might be more advantageous for most container exports 4. Buyers should also be aware that the insurance obtained by the seller under CIF is typically for minimum coverage, and they might need additional insurance depending on the nature of the goods and the perceived risks 31.

**Delivered at Place (DAP)**

Delivered at Place (DAP) is an Incoterm suitable for all modes of transport, including containerized and multimodal shipments 1. Under DAP, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the named place of destination, ready for unloading by the buyer 7. The seller assumes all risks involved in bringing the goods to the named place 34. The seller is responsible for loading the goods at origin, and the buyer is responsible for unloading the goods from the arriving means of transport at the named place of destination 34.

Under DAP, the seller bears the costs of origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, and inland haulage to the named place of destination 37. The buyer is responsible for import customs clearance costs, import duties and taxes 7. While the seller bears the risk until delivery, they are not obligated to insure the shipment, although they might choose to do so given their risk exposure 35. The risk of loss or damage to the goods under DAP transfers from the seller to the buyer when the goods are available for unloading at the named place of destination 34. A key aspect of DAP is the precise identification of the destination, as both cost and risk transfer at this point 34. Buyers using DAP need to be prepared to handle the unloading of the goods and the import customs clearance procedures 34.

**Delivered at Place Unloaded (DPU)**

Delivered at Place Unloaded (DPU) is an Incoterm suitable for all modes of transport, including containerized and multimodal shipments 1. Introduced in Incoterms 2020, DPU replaced DAT (Delivered at Terminal) to broaden the scope of the delivery location beyond just a terminal 1. What distinguishes DPU is that the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the named place of destination and unloading them 2. The seller is responsible for loading at origin and unloading at the destination 38.

Under DPU, the seller bears the costs of origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, and inland haulage to the named place of destination, including the cost of unloading the goods 38. The buyer is responsible for import customs clearance costs and import duties and taxes 38. The seller retains the risk until the goods are unloaded at the named place of destination 38. The risk of loss or damage transfers to the buyer when the goods are unloaded and made available at the destination 38. A potential challenge with DPU can arise if import clearance is required before unloading, as unloading is the seller's responsibility under this term 38. In such cases, DAP might be a more suitable option 38.

**Delivered Duty Paid (DDP)**

Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) is an Incoterm suitable for all modes of transport, including containerized and multimodal shipments 1. DDP places the maximum obligation on the seller, who is responsible for delivering the goods to the named place of destination, cleared for import, and with all duties and taxes paid 2. The buyer's only responsibility is typically unloading the goods at the final destination 7. The seller is responsible for loading at origin, and the buyer is responsible for unloading at destination 42.

Under DDP, the seller bears almost all costs associated with the international shipment, including origin terminal handling charges, loading onto the vessel, ocean freight, destination terminal handling charges, unloading from the vessel, inland haulage to the destination, import customs clearance costs, and import duties and taxes 42. The seller also bears the risk of loss or damage to the goods until they are made available to the buyer at the named place of destination 42. The risk transfers to the buyer when the goods arrive at the buyer's premises 44. A significant challenge for the seller using DDP is the need to be registered in the buyer's country for import and VAT/GST purposes, which can be a complex undertaking 45. If the seller cannot fulfill these import obligations, DAP should be considered instead 35. While DDP offers maximum convenience to the buyer, it can potentially result in a higher overall cost as the seller includes all expenses and risks in the price 44.

**3\. Comparative Analysis of Incoterms 2020 in the Context of International Container Shipments and Multimodal Transport:**

The choice of Incoterm significantly influences the balance of responsibilities, cost allocation, and risk transfer between the buyer and seller in international container shipments and multimodal transport 1. Incoterms can be broadly categorized into four groups: "E" (EXW), "F" (FCA, FAS, FOB), "C" (CPT, CIP, CFR, CIF), and "D" (DAP, DPU, DDP), each representing a different level of obligation for the seller. Buyers seeking maximum control over logistics and costs might lean towards "F" terms, where the buyer arranges and pays for the main carriage. Conversely, buyers prioritizing convenience and minimal involvement in the shipping process might prefer "D" terms, where the seller takes on more responsibility for delivering the goods to the destination 1. Sellers, on the other hand, aim to balance their obligations with the price they can charge and the level of risk they are willing to assume.

For containerized multimodal shipments, it is generally recommended to use Incoterms designed for any mode of transport (EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, DPU, DDP) 1. The sea-and-inland-waterway-only terms (FAS, FOB, CFR, CIF) are often less suitable for standard container shipments because their risk transfer points, which occur at or before loading onto the vessel, do not align well with the typical process of delivering containers to a terminal for subsequent loading 1. The ICC recommends using Incoterms suitable for any mode of transport for container shipments to avoid ambiguities related to the point of risk and cost transfer in multimodal scenarios involving container terminals 1.

**4\. Summary of Responsibilities, Cost Allocations, and Risk Transfer Points:**

The following table provides a concise summary of the key aspects of each Incoterm 2020 rule as it pertains to international container shipments and multimodal transport:

| Incoterm | Applicable to Containers? | Loading Responsibility (Into Container) | Origin THC | Loading onto Vessel | Ocean Freight | Insurance | Destination THC | Unloading from Vessel | Inland Haulage (Destination) | Import Clearance | Import Duties/Taxes | Risk Transfer Point |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| EXW | Yes (Not Recommended) | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Seller's Premises (Ready for Loading) |
| FCA | Yes | Seller (Seller's Premise), Buyer (Other) | Seller/Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Agreed Place (Handover to Carrier) |
| FAS | No | Buyer | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Alongside Ship (Port of Shipment) |
| FOB | No | Seller | Seller | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | On Board Vessel (Port of Shipment) |
| CPT | Yes | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Buyer | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | First Carrier (Named Place) |
| CIP | Yes | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | First Carrier (Named Place) |
| CFR | No | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | On Board Vessel (Port of Shipment) |
| CIF | No | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | Buyer | On Board Vessel (Port of Shipment) |
| DAP | Yes | Buyer (Unloading) | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Named Place of Destination (Ready for Unloading) |
| DPU | Yes | Seller (Unloading) | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Buyer | Buyer | Named Place of Destination (Unloaded) |
| DDP | Yes | Buyer (Unloading) | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Seller | Named Place of Destination (Ready for Unloading) |

**5\. Conclusions:**

The analysis of Incoterms 2020 reveals significant implications for international container shipments within multimodal transport chains. While all eleven Incoterms define responsibilities, cost allocations, and risk transfer points, their suitability for containerized multimodal transport varies considerably. The maritime-specific terms (FAS, FOB, CFR, CIF) often present challenges due to their risk transfer occurring at the port of shipment, which does not align with the common practice of container handling at terminals. For standard international container shipments, Incoterms applicable to any mode of transport (EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, DPU, DDP) generally provide a clearer and more appropriate framework.

Buyers and sellers should carefully consider their specific needs and capabilities when selecting an Incoterm. Terms like FCA, CPT, and CIP offer a balance of responsibility and are well-suited for containerized transport, with CIP providing the added benefit of mandatory seller-provided insurance. The "D" terms (DAP, DPU, DDP) place increasing responsibility on the seller for delivery to the destination, with DDP representing the maximum obligation for the seller, including import duties and taxes. DPU is a notable update in Incoterms 2020, explicitly assigning unloading responsibility to the seller. Conversely, EXW places the maximum burden on the buyer and is generally not recommended for international container shipments. Ultimately, the selection of the most appropriate Incoterm requires a thorough understanding of each rule's implications and a clear agreement between the buyer and the seller, documented precisely in the sales contract, including the specific named place of delivery or destination.
