# Regulation of Container Logistics at Yangshan Port (Shanghai): Impact of China's Legal Framework

Yangshan Port in Shanghai represents one of the world's most significant container handling facilities, operating under a complex regulatory framework that continues to evolve. This report examines how China's maritime legal system shapes container logistics operations at this strategic port, with particular focus on recent regulatory developments that enhance its role as an international shipping hub.

## Port of Yangshan: Strategic Context and Development

Yangshan Port, located approximately 30 kilometers south of Shanghai, has established itself as the world's busiest container port and a cornerstone of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Since its establishment in 2005, the port has undergone four phases of expansion, with total investments reaching RMB 37 billion between 2002-2008[6]. The port features the world's largest automated container terminal, utilizing 130 automatically controlled vehicles (AGVs) alongside numerous bridge and gantry cranes that operate with minimal human intervention[6]. This intelligent production management control system not only increases operational efficiency but also reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 10%[6].

The port has been strategically designed to handle over 40 million TEUs annually, with facilities capable of accommodating the largest container vessels in global shipping[6]. Its location at the end of the 32.5-kilometer Donghai Bridge connects it to mainland transport networks, while its designation as China's first state-level free port covering 7.2 square kilometers enhances its commercial significance[9].

## Maritime Code of the People's Republic of China: Fundamental Framework

The Maritime Code of the PRC establishes the foundational legal framework governing shipping activities, including those at Yangshan Port. This comprehensive legislation addresses multiple aspects of maritime transportation, though notably "shall not be applicable to the maritime transport of goods between the ports of the People's Republic of China" (Article 2)[1].

The Code clearly defines ships as "sea-going ships and other mobile units" excluding military vessels, public service craft, and small ships under 20 tons (Article 3)[1]. It establishes that a contract of carriage constitutes an agreement where "the carrier, against payment of freight, undertakes to carry by sea the goods contracted for shipment by the shipper from one port to another" (Article 41)[1]. Importantly, the Code requires carriers to "exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy" and ensure vessel components are "fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation" of goods (Article 47)[1].

The carrier's obligations extend to handling cargo with proper care throughout the transportation process, as stipulated in Article 48: "The carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried"[1]. These provisions establish critical standards for container handling at Yangshan, ensuring consistent service quality across international shipments.

## Regulations on International Maritime Transportation: Recent Reforms

The Regulations of the PRC on International Maritime Transportation govern international shipping activities to and from Chinese ports, including Yangshan. These regulations are "applicable to international maritime transportation business operations to and from the ports of the People's Republic of China as well as the auxiliary business operations relating to international maritime transportation" (Article 2)[7].

Significant amendments were implemented on July 20, 2023, streamlining administrative procedures for international shipping operators. A key change eliminates the requirement for prior approval for international container transport operators, international general cargo transport operators, and Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers (NVOCCs)[5]. These entities now simply need to file records with provincial transport management administrations within 15 days after commencing or terminating business[5].

The regulatory amendments also shifted the administrative management of transportation between mainland China and Hong Kong/Macau from the State Council to provincial governments, simplifying processes for international operators[5]. This decentralization represents part of China's broader efforts to reduce administrative barriers in the shipping industry.

## Special Policies for Yangshan Port: Pilot Programs and Provisional Adjustments

Yangshan Port benefits from unique regulatory provisions that enhance its position as an international transhipment hub. In a significant development, China has established pilot programs allowing foreign shipping lines to engage in limited cabotage operations through Yangshan.

The State Council approved interim adjustments to maritime transport regulations effective from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2027[4]. Under these provisions, "eligible international voyage ships without the Five-Starred Red Flag, wholly owned or controlled by international container liner companies from foreign countries, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Macao Special Administrative Region, will be allowed to pilot coastal shipping for foreign trade containers between Dalian Port, Tianjin Port, Qingdao Port, Lianyungang Port and Yangshan Port in Shanghai, with Yangshan Port as the port of trans-shipment"[4].

This policy renewal builds upon an earlier pilot project that ran until December 31, 2024, which permitted non-Chinese flagged vessels to "carry foreign trade containers to and from the Yangshan Port to promote the construction of the Shanghai International Shipping Center"[2]. The program specifies that participating vessels must be "intercontinental ocean-going trunk ships" carrying only "foreign trade container cargo for which the international container liner company has issued a full bill of lading"[2].

These special provisions significantly enhance Yangshan's functionality as a logistics hub by:
1. Diversifying route options for import-export enterprises
2. Enhancing efficiency of "water-to-water" transshipment for cargo headed to northern ports
3. Facilitating smoother logistics through Shanghai for imports to Dalian, Tianjin, and Qingdao[3]

## Environmental Protection Requirements

Maritime operations at Yangshan Port must comply with China's Marine Environment Protection Law, which underwent significant amendments effective January 1, 2024. The law now incorporates requirements from the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments to prevent the invasion of exotic organisms[8].

Vessels operating at Yangshan are prohibited from "illegally discharging garbage, domestic sewage, oily sewage, sewage containing toxic and hazardous substances, pollutants, waste, ballast water and sediments, and other harmful substance into the sea areas under the jurisdiction of P.R.C."[8]. They must implement effective measures for treating ballast water and sediments, with proper monitoring and record-keeping[8].

The amended law imposes enhanced obligations on shippers, cargo owners, and agents handling hazardous cargo. Before delivering such cargo, shippers must "truthfully inform the carrier of the official name of the cargo to be carried, its hazard and protective measures to be taken"[8]. Additionally, vessel structures and anti-pollution equipment must comply with relevant regulations and undergo qualification examinations[8].

## Free Port Status and Logistics Implications

Yangshan Port's designation as China's first state-level free port creates a uniquely open environment for international logistics operations. The free port area covers 7.2 square kilometers divided into three parts: 1.2 square kilometers in the port itself, the 32.5-kilometer Donghai Bridge, and a 6 square kilometer area at the northern end of the bridge in Lingang New Area[9].

This status represents "the most open area yet created in China," applying policies traditionally limited to bonded zones and export processing facilities[9]. The free port designation enhances Yangshan's competitiveness by facilitating more efficient cargo movement, reducing administrative barriers, and creating a more favorable environment for international trade.

The port's transshipment and consolidation business has shown impressive growth, with Yangshan surpassing 5 million TEUs in transshipment and consolidation volumes in 2024[3]. Within the special comprehensive bonded zone, goods from international transit, domestic exports, and bonded warehouses are combined and consolidated, maximizing logistical efficiency[3].

## Challenges and Future Perspectives

Yangshan Port continues to evolve as a technologically advanced logistics hub, with automation driving efficiency improvements. The port demonstrates how "ports of the future may look," with automated systems replacing manual labor in repetitive activities[6]. The intelligent production management system collects and processes data before sending instructions to machines, which execute orders without human intervention, though highly qualified personnel remain essential for supervision[6].

The regulatory framework governing Yangshan will likely continue evolving to support Shanghai's ambitions of becoming a premier international shipping center. The renewal of the coastal shipping pilot program until 2027 indicates China's commitment to gradually opening specific shipping segments to international participation while maintaining overall control of domestic maritime transportation.

## Conclusion

The legal framework governing container logistics at Yangshan Port represents a complex interplay between China's fundamental maritime laws, international shipping regulations, and special provisions designed to enhance Shanghai's position as a global shipping hub. The Maritime Code establishes core principles for shipping contracts and carrier obligations, while the Regulations on International Maritime Transportation govern international shipping activities with recent reforms simplifying administrative procedures.

Yangshan's unique status benefits from provisional adjustments allowing limited foreign participation in domestic shipping routes, enhancing the port's role as a transshipment hub. These regulatory innovations, combined with environmental protection requirements and free port status, position Yangshan as both a logistics powerhouse and a testing ground for China's evolving approach to international shipping regulation.
