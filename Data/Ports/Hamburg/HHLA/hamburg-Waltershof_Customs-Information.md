## 1. Introduction - Changes in Port of Hamburg Customs Processes & General German Customs Context

*   **Fundamental Changes (from Dec 1, 2012):** Abolition of Freeport of Hamburg leads to fundamental changes in customs processes, requiring understanding of temporary storage.
*   **Customs Sea Port - Temporary Storage:** Goods in customs seaport are under customs supervision and placed under temporary storage upon arrival (AT/B number).

*   **General Handover Rule:** Goods generally handed over only after storage is accomplished (e.g., T1 transit procedure, release for free circulation, "change of depositary").
*   **Potential Reason for Handover Refusal:** Unresolved temporary storage can be a reason for loading point to refuse consignment handover.
*   **General German Customs Clearance Context:**  Understanding German customs clearance is crucial for smooth logistics operations. Key aspects include required documents, procedures, regulations, and compliance (as detailed in the FAQs below).
