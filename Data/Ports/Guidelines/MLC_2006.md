**1. Overview: Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006)**

*   **Description:** The MLC, 2006, is a comprehensive international labour convention adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) that establishes minimum working and living standards for *all* seafarers working on ships flying the flag of ratifying countries. It's often called the "Seafarers' Bill of Rights."
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Decent Work for Seafarers:** To ensure that seafarers have decent working and living conditions, regardless of their nationality or the flag of the ship they work on.
    *   **Fair Competition:** To create a level playing field for shipowners by ensuring that all ships are subject to the same minimum labour standards, preventing unfair competition from substandard ships.
    *   **Global Standards:** To establish globally recognized standards for seafarers' rights and working conditions.
    *   **Protection of Seafarers' Rights:** To protect seafarers' fundamental rights, including their right to:
        *   A safe and secure workplace.
        *   Fair terms of employment.
        *   Decent living conditions on board.
        *   Health protection, medical care, welfare measures, and other forms of social protection.
*   **History:**
    *   The MLC, 2006, consolidates and updates more than 65 existing ILO maritime labour instruments adopted since 1920.
    *   It was adopted in 2006 and entered into force on 20 August 2013.
    *   It has been widely ratified by countries representing the vast majority of the world's shipping tonnage.
*   **Structure:** The MLC, 2006, is structured in a unique way:
    *   **Articles:** The main body of the Convention sets out the general principles and obligations.
    *   **Regulations:** Broadly stated requirements.
    *   **Code:** The Code provides detailed provisions for implementing the Regulations. It's divided into two parts:
        *   **Part A (Mandatory Standards):** These are *mandatory* requirements that ratifying countries *must* implement.
        *   **Part B (Non-mandatory Guidelines):** These provide guidance on how to implement the Standards, but they are not legally binding.

**2. Key Provisions of the MLC, 2006**

The MLC, 2006, covers a wide range of issues related to seafarers' working and living conditions. These are grouped under five "Titles":

*   **Title 1: Minimum Requirements for Seafarers to Work on a Ship:**
    *   **Minimum Age:**  Generally, the minimum age for working on a ship is 16, with stricter rules for hazardous work and night work.
    *   **Medical Fitness:** Seafarers must hold a valid medical certificate attesting to their fitness for duty. The certificate must meet specific standards.
    *   **Training and Qualifications:** Seafarers must be adequately trained and qualified for their duties, in accordance with the STCW Convention (as we've discussed).
    *   **Recruitment and Placement:** Seafarers should have access to fair and regulated recruitment and placement services.

*   **Title 2: Conditions of Employment:**
    *   **Seafarers' Employment Agreements (SEAs):** Seafarers must have a clear, legally enforceable employment agreement that sets out their terms and conditions of employment.
    *   **Wages:** Seafarers must be paid regularly and in full. The MLC, 2006, doesn't set a specific minimum wage, but it requires that wages be paid at least monthly and that seafarers have a means to transmit their earnings to their families.
    *   **Hours of Work and Rest:**  The MLC, 2006, sets limits on working hours and minimum requirements for rest periods to prevent fatigue.  This is closely linked to the watchkeeping provisions of the STCW Convention. The standard is a maximum of 14 hours of work in any 24-hour period and 72 hours in any seven-day period; *or* a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and 77 hours in any seven-day period.
    *   **Paid Annual Leave:** Seafarers are entitled to paid annual leave.
    *   **Repatriation:** Seafarers have the right to be repatriated (returned home) at the end of their contract, or in other circumstances (e.g., illness, shipwreck), at no cost to themselves. Shipowners must have financial security in place to cover the costs of repatriation.
    *   **Shipowner's Liability:** Shipowners are liable for the health and safety of seafarers on board and must provide medical care, sickness benefits, and compensation for injury, illness, or death.

*   **Title 3: Accommodation, Recreational Facilities, Food and Catering:**
    *   **Accommodation:** The MLC, 2006, sets detailed standards for seafarers' accommodation on board, covering aspects such as:
        *   Room size and layout.
        *   Heating, ventilation, and lighting.
        *   Sanitary facilities.
        *   Noise and vibration levels.
    *   **Recreational Facilities:** Ships must provide adequate recreational facilities for seafarers (e.g., a mess room, a library, space for exercise).
    *   **Food and Catering:** Ships must provide seafarers with good quality food and drinking water, free of charge, and catering arrangements that meet their religious and cultural needs.

*   **Title 4: Health Protection, Medical Care, Welfare and Social Security Protection:**
    *   **Medical Care on Board:** Ships must have a medical chest, medical equipment, and a suitably trained person (or persons, depending on ship size and voyage) to provide medical care on board. Larger ships may be required to have a doctor.
    *   **Access to Shore-Based Medical Care:** Seafarers must have access to prompt and adequate medical care in port.
    *   **Health and Safety Protection and Accident Prevention:** Shipowners must take measures to prevent occupational accidents, injuries, and diseases on board, and to promote a safe working environment.
    *   **Social Security:** The MLC, 2006, encourages countries to provide social security protection for seafarers.

*   **Title 5: Compliance and Enforcement:**
    *   **Flag State Responsibilities:** Flag States (the countries where ships are registered) are responsible for ensuring that ships flying their flag comply with the MLC, 2006. This involves:
        *   Inspections and certification of ships.
        *   Investigation of complaints.
        *   Enforcement action against non-compliant ships.
    *   **Port State Control:** Port States (countries that ships visit) also have the authority to inspect foreign-flagged ships to verify compliance with the MLC, 2006.  This is a *key* enforcement mechanism.  Port State Control officers can detain ships if they find serious deficiencies.
    *   **Maritime Labour Certificate and Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance (DMLC):** Ships over a certain size (generally 500 gross tonnage and above) engaged in international voyages must carry a Maritime Labour Certificate and a DMLC.
        *   **Maritime Labour Certificate:**  Issued by the flag State after an inspection, certifying that the ship complies with the MLC, 2006.
        *   **DMLC (Part I and Part II):**
            *   **Part I:** Drawn up by the flag State, identifying the national laws and regulations that implement the MLC, 2006.
            *   **Part II:** Drawn up by the shipowner, outlining the measures they have taken to ensure ongoing compliance with the MLC, 2006 on the ship.
    *   **On-board Complaint Procedures:** Ships must have procedures in place for seafarers to lodge complaints about breaches of the MLC, 2006 requirements.
    *   **Shore-based Seafarer Welfare Facilities:** Port States should provide access to welfare facilities for seafarers in their ports.

**3. Relevance to International Container Multimodal Logistics**

*   **Essential for Seafarer Welfare:** The MLC, 2006, is *fundamental* to protecting the rights and well-being of seafarers who work on container ships, which are a critical part of the global supply chain.
*   **Port State Control:** Port State Control inspections under the MLC, 2006, can impact the operation of container ships. Deficiencies can lead to delays and detentions, disrupting schedules and increasing costs.
*   **Reputational Risk:** Shipping companies that fail to comply with the MLC, 2006, face reputational damage and potential legal action.
*   **Fair Competition:** The MLC, 2006, helps to ensure fair competition in the shipping industry by preventing substandard operators from gaining an unfair advantage by exploiting seafarers.
*   **Supply Chain Responsibility:** Increasingly, companies throughout the supply chain (e.g., cargo owners, retailers) are paying attention to labour standards in shipping, including compliance with the MLC, 2006.

**4. Amendments**

* There are several amendments to the MLC, the most recent are from 2022, entering into force in December 2024. These address issues such as:
    *   Personal protective equipment (PPE) sized for the individual seafarer.
    *   Provision of drinking water free of charge.
    *   Improved connectivity for seafarers to communicate with family.
    *   Information on rights related to compensation for death or long-term disability.

The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006), is a landmark international agreement that has significantly improved the working and living conditions of seafarers worldwide. It's a critical instrument for promoting decent work, fair competition, and the safety and well-being of the men and women who operate the world's ships, including the container ships that are essential for global trade. Compliance with the MLC, 2006, is not just a legal obligation; it's a moral imperative and a key aspect of responsible business practice in the maritime industry.
