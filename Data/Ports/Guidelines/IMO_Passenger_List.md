Here's a comprehensive report about the IMO Passenger List (FAL Form 6), based on the image you provided, combined with relevant external information:

**1. Document Overview: IMO Passenger List (FAL Form 6)**

*   **Description:** The IMO Passenger List (FAL Form 6) is a standardized form used to provide port authorities with information about passengers on board a ship arriving at or departing from a port. It is part of the IMO's FAL Convention, aimed at simplifying and standardizing maritime documentation.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Immigration Control:**  The primary purpose is to facilitate immigration and border control checks. It enables authorities to verify the identity and documentation of each passenger.
    *   **Security:**  It contributes to port and maritime security by allowing authorities to track the movement of individuals entering and leaving a country via sea.
    *   **Emergency Response:** In case of an emergency (e.g., a maritime accident), the Passenger List is crucial for identifying and accounting for all individuals on board.
    *   **Public Health:**  It can be used to assist public health authorities, particularly in situations involving the spread of infectious diseases.
    *   **Statistical Purposes:** The data can be used for statistical analysis of passenger movements.
*   **Importance in International Container Logistics:**
    While less directly relevant to *cargo* operations than some other FAL forms, the Passenger List is still important in specific situations within container logistics:
    *   **Mixed-Use Vessels:**  Some container ships may also carry a limited number of passengers (e.g., supercargoes, individuals traveling for business reasons related to the cargo, or occasionally, paying passengers on freighter cruises). The Passenger List is required for these individuals.
    *  **RoRo Vessels:** A RoRo Ship will also be subject to have a Passenger List, if passengers present.
    *   **Port Security:** Port security encompasses *all* individuals entering and leaving the port area, including passengers on any type of vessel. The Passenger List contributes to overall port security.
    *   **Vessel Clearance:** Delays in processing passenger information can, in principle, delay the overall clearance of the vessel, even if its primary purpose is cargo transport.
*   **When Used:** The form is used on both *arrival* at a port and *departure*.

**2. Document Structure and Key Information (Based on the Image)**

The IMO Passenger List (FAL Form 6) is designed to collect data in a structured, MECE manner, and contains:

*   **Header Information:**
    *   Indication of "Arrival" or "Departure" (checkboxes).
    *   Page Number.

*   **Ship Identification (1.1 - 1.3, 4):**
    *   1.1 Name and type of ship
    *   1.2 IMO number
    *   1.3 Call sign
    *   4. Flag State of ship

*   **Voyage Information (2, 3):**
    *   2. Port of arrival/departure
    *   3. Date of arrival/departure

*   **Passenger Details (A table with columns 5-12):**
    *   5. Family name, given names (full name of each passenger)
    *   6. Nationality
    *   7. Date and place of birth
    *   8. Type of identity document (e.g., passport, national ID card)
    *   9. Serial number of identity document
    *   10. Port of embarkation (where the passenger boarded the ship)
    *   11. Port of disembarkation (where the passenger will leave the ship)
    *   12. Transit passenger or not (indicates whether the passenger is simply passing through the port or disembarking there)

*   **Signature (10):**
    *   10. Date and signature by master, authorized agent, or officer.

**3. Guidelines for Filling the IMO Passenger List**

*   **Obtain the Correct Form:** Use the official IMO FAL Form 6.
*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** This is crucial.  Errors or missing information can lead to significant problems for passengers and delays for the vessel.
*   **Legibility:**  Fill out the form clearly, either typed or in legible handwriting.
*   **Specific Instructions:**
    *   **Ship and Voyage Information:** Use the ship's official documentation for accurate details.
    *   **Passenger Details:**
        *   **Full Names:** Use the names *exactly* as they appear on the passengers' travel documents.
        *   **Nationality:** Use the nationality as stated on the passenger's identity document.
        *   **Date and Place of Birth:** Enter accurately.
        *   **Identity Document:**
            *   **Type:** Specify the type of document (e.g., "Passport," "National ID Card").
            *   **Serial Number:** Enter the document number *very carefully*.
        *   **Embarkation/Disembarkation:** Clearly indicate where each passenger boarded and will disembark.
        *   **Transit Passenger:**  Accurately mark whether each passenger is a transit passenger.
    *   **Signature:**  The form *must* be signed by the ship's master, an authorized officer, or the ship's agent.
*   **Electronic Submission:** While the provided image shows a paper form, the IMO encourages the electronic submission of FAL Forms, including the Passenger List.

**4. Best Practices and Additional Considerations**

*   **Advance Submission:** Submit the Passenger List *well in advance* of the ship's arrival, particularly if there are a large number of passengers. This allows authorities to pre-screen passengers and address any potential issues before the ship arrives.
*   **Consistency with Travel Documents:** Ensure that all information on the Passenger List is *completely consistent* with the passengers' actual travel documents.
*   **Passenger Manifest Systems:**  Larger passenger vessels (cruise ships, ferries) use sophisticated electronic passenger manifest systems that are often integrated with port and immigration systems.  These systems can generate the IMO Passenger List automatically.
* **Security Screening:**  The information on the Passenger List may be used for security screening against watchlists and databases.
*   **Data Privacy:** Handle passenger data with strict adherence to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR in Europe).
*   **National Regulations:** Be aware of any specific national regulations regarding passenger entry and exit.  Visa requirements, health declarations, and other rules may vary significantly.
* **APIS (Advanced Passenger Information System):** Many countries require airlines and, increasingly, maritime operators to submit passenger data in advance through APIS. The Passenger List may be used in conjunction with APIS data.
* **Cruise Ships vs. Cargo Vessels:** It is essential to distinguish between requirements for dedicated cruise ships (which have extensive passenger handling procedures) and cargo vessels that might occasionally carry a few passengers. The level of scrutiny and the systems used will differ significantly.

**5. Real-World Implications and Connections to Other Regulations**

* **ISPS Code:** The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code has implications for passenger handling, particularly on ships that carry both cargo and passengers. The Passenger List contributes to the security measures required by the ISPS Code.
*   **Schengen Area:** The search results mention the Schengen Area (in Europe), where specific rules apply to passenger entry and transit. The Passenger List is a key document for complying with Schengen regulations.
*   **e-Borders Programs:** Many countries are implementing "e-Borders" programs that involve the electronic collection and analysis of passenger data. The Passenger List is becoming increasingly integrated into these systems.

The IMO Passenger List, though seemingly simple, is a critical document for managing the movement of people by sea. Its accurate and timely completion is essential for immigration control, security, and efficient port operations. The trend towards electronic submission and integration with other systems is further streamlining this process.
