Here's a report on the IMO Crew List (FAL Form 5), combining information from the provided image with insights from the search results:

**1. Document Overview: IMO Crew List (FAL Form 5)**

*   **Description:** The IMO Crew List (FAL Form 5) is a standardized document used to provide port authorities with details about the crew members of a ship arriving at or departing from a port. It's a key component of the IMO's efforts to facilitate international maritime traffic.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Immigration Control:**  The primary purpose is to facilitate immigration checks. It provides authorities with information needed to verify the identity and documentation of each crew member.
    *   **Security:**  It contributes to port security by allowing authorities to identify and track individuals working on board ships.
    *   **Customs Control:** Although not the primary focus, the Crew List can support customs controls, particularly in relation to crew effects (covered by FAL Form 4).  The search results confirm that customs authorities often use the Crew List.
    *   **Statistical Data:** The information can also be used for statistical purposes related to maritime labor.
    *  **Compliance:** It facilitates the implementation of the ILO's Seafarers' Identity Documents Convention.
*   **Importance in International Container Logistics:**
    *   **Vessel Clearance:** The Crew List is essential for the smooth clearance of the *vessel* itself (distinct from cargo clearance).  Delays in providing accurate crew information can hold up the entire ship.
    *   **Crew Changes:** It's critical for managing crew changes, ensuring that joining and departing crew members are properly documented. This is highlighted in several search results, showing its importance for crew repatriation and replacement.
    *   **Compliance with International Regulations:** It helps ensure compliance with the IMO FAL Convention and various international labor conventions (like the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006) and STCW).
    * **Port State Control:** Port State Control officers may inspect the Crew List and related seafarer documentation to verify compliance.
*   **When Used:** The form is required both on *arrival* at a port and on *departure*.
